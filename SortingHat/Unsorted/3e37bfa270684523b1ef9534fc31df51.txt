This month apparently I lost no fat whatsoever. I�ve eaten a lot healthier and more paleo overall than ever before, limiting my daily processed carb/sugar intake to under 10g, but since I�ve been working at an ice cream shop, two days a week end up being sugar days where I eat 2 scoops of ice cream, and then once every two weeks I buy pastries for a pastry/travel blog post. It�s really annoying that the rule of eat 80% clean doesn�t seem to be working for me, apparently I need to eat 90% clean or better, or my extra fat will be sticking around for fucking ever.
