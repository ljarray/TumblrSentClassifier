
Paths: Full Circle
It�s the late night relaxation
Jazz tone vibrations 
The sensation that everything might be ok after all
Spent so long on the fall
Now you�re adjusting to the vertigo 
You feel so small with your chipped tooth and achy palms
Red in the face from the blood reigniting in your system
This is gonna take a minute but you aren�t counting the seconds anymore
Just the times you smiled today 
Anything past none is an improvement
Kissed the sun on the way to the market 
Caressed the moon and winked at the planets making room for your growth
Moving with a newfound grace 
No need to resume your self destructive ways
Instead kissing each and every way you love yourself
Your body isn�t used to this kind of attention
It expects razor blade kisses and pits of morose
Now you give it sunlight and water and passion
Soft words and hints of lemon
Thinking about where you�ve come from
How far you plan to go
Roadmaps and passports and wishing safe travels 
Strangers become friends writing adventures on your soul
Leaving you with crows feet and a full heart
It was written in the ways you decided to hold on
Now there are stars in your hands and your palms aren�t so achy anymore
They carry with them the gift of life
