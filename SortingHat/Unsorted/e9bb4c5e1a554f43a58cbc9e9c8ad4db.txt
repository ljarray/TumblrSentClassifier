
Creamy Sweet Potato Pasta Bake
This is one of my current FAVOURITE meals - it�s HCLF, loaded with veggies and vitamin B12 from the nutritional yeast, and is SO easy to make! Enjoy!

Sauce

1 � large sweet potatoes
� tsp garlic powder or clove of fresh garlic
1 tsp dijon mustard 
2 tbsp nutritional yeast
Salt and pepper to taste
Plant milk of choice

Topping
2 slices bread (or pre-made breadcrumbs) 
2 tbsp nutritional yeast

Other ingredients 
1 packet pasta 
Handful of mushrooms sliced
Half a head of broccoli 
Cup of peas

Method
Chop sweet potato into small cubes and roast in medium oven until soft. Place in mixing bowl with all other sauce ingredients and blend until smooth. Use as much or as little milk as you need to get a nice, mixable consistency (not too thick!). I used probably close to a cup of almond milk.

In the meantime, cook pasta according to packet directions. Once cooked, drain and return to saucepan. Stir through chopped veggies (make them fairly small) and add sauce. Stir until well combined.

In a blender, process bread until you have breadcrumbs. Combine with nutritional yeast and spread evenly on top of pasta.

Place in oven and cook for 20-30 minutes until veggies are cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden brown.

Note 
I used unsweetened almond milk and corn pasta, but use whatever you prefer. You could also sub the veggies for whatever you have on hand - zucchini, capsicum, corn etc! 

Have a play around with the sauce ratios to your own taste - I personally LOVE lots of nutritional yeast on mine!
