
I finally understand. A healthy lifestyle is key. There is no one diet. There is no one workout program. It is never ending. A diet might help you lose weight for a short period of time, but a healthy lifestyle will keep you in shape forever. You have to make the change. It is not restricting. You have to listen to your body. What works for one person will not work the same for you. Listen to your body. If you�re hungry, eat! If you�re not, don�t! Drink lots of water. Do your best. Don�t eat processed foods. Eat wholesome foods made by God grown in the earth. Eat in moderation. Junk food is OKAY once in a while. Chemicals in small doses are not harmful. Your body is smart. It knows how to get rid of toxins. Move your body. Become stronger so life�s tasks are easier. Don�t workout because you have to, workout because you respect your body and want to give it what it needs. Take a rest day if you need to. Work around your schedule. Get plenty of sleep. Don�t drive yourself crazy trying to follow a specific meal plan or workout guide. Just do the best you can with what you have. Love yourself!! Love your body now. Then, and only then, will the results show. Healthy looks different on everyone, but it looks beautiful on everyone.
