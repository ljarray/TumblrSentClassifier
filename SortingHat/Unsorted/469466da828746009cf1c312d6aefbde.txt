So today I am going to post some of the things I find useful to distract me when I start to feel weak. I�m sure you�ve heard a lot of these before, these are just the ones that I find work particularly well in my case. Hope it helps!

O1. Drink water! It�s best to sip it all day long rather than chug it, but if you�re feeling particularly hungry then drink more to help you feel fuller. 
O2. Get hooked on a good TV series! I love TV shows and so I find this works particularly well. Some good ones are Humans, UnREAL, Extant, Mr. Robot, Wayward Pines, Finding Carter, Made in Chelsea, Orphan Black, Project Runway, the Leftovers. If you want a specific genre suggestion (sci-if, drama, comedy etc) send me an ask I basically know every good tv show worth watching! 
O3. Paint your nails. It�s really hard to eat when your nails are wet so paint em up ladies.
O4. Do your make up or pick out outfits. I always find I stop thinking about eating so much when I feel good about myself. So I do my make up or my hair, and pick out cute outfits! 
O5. Have a shower. Feeling fresh and clean, for some reason, takes your mind completely off your hunger. 
O6. Thinspo!! Thinspo is your best friend. You�ll find it much more difficult to give in to food when you have perfection staring you in the face.
O7. Make a playlist. When I�m feeling particularly weak I like to make a bunch of playlists for different moods. Like I�ll do a car cruising playlist, an angry playlist, and a nostalgia playlist. I�m super OCD so I can�t stop until I�m done and it�s perfect, so eating isn�t an options for at least an hour. 
O8. Write about what your feeling. Keeping a food journal can help in so many different aspects of dieting. But getting it all out on paper will stop you from emotionally eating, and has the added bonus of distracting you from your hunger. At the end of the week look back through your journal for patterns. For example what time you feel weak at will probably reoccur. When you figure out what time that�s at you can make plans or schedule workouts, or just make sure your busy at that time. Or you might find when your with a certain person or doing something specific, you end up eating more. Recognizing patterns can help you reduce the risk of breaking your diet, 
O9. Brush your teeth. No one likes to eat after they�ve brushed their teeth! 
10. If nothing is working then eat. It�s probably a sign your body needs the fuel. But try something light first like grapes. Eat a few grapes and then WAIT 2O MINUTES! it takes that long for your brain to tell you your tummy is full!
