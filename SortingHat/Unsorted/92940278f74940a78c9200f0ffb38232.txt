
Goals
I was trying to convince myself that I didn�t need abs, that I was perfectly ok with the body I have and I don�t need to go �crazy�. But that would be a lie. I want to keep continually working on my body to improve it, not out of hatred, but because I love seeing what it can do. I can�t give up just because it�s that time of the month. My goal is to see visible abs and weigh around nine and a half stone. I think I can do it.
