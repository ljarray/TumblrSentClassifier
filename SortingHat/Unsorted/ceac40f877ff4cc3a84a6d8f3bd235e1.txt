
The fucked up thing is...
I know for a fact I�ll be happy when im skinny again. I remember. It was great. I felt alive. Not ashamed. I felt in control. And thats the fucked up thing living with these thoughts in your head.

I need to go back there. I didnt have a care in the world. I didnt even have to think about the disorder. I just went out with friends and lived my life. Now all i do is binge eat and cry because im fat.

I cant do this anymore. I cant live that anymore.

I need thin.

I need to be in control again.

The eating disorder is in control when I am not. I need to find myself again�hidden behind this fat and calories.
