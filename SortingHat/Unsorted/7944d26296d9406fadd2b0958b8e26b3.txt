
tbh almost any time ive seen some positive body image pics of fat people they almost always have just underwear on and lots of makeup and have usually a face that complies with standard beauty norms and they also usually have defined waistlines and no bulges etc, like fat people have to reach so far to be comparable even in the slightest to thin people
