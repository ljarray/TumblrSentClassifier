
girls don?t give random dudes online the power to make you feel good about your appearance.

when they say you?re hot they mean they?ll feel powerful if you respond to them.

when they say you?re not hot they mean they feel powerful when they make you feel bad.

good guys will have their preferences of what they?re attracted to, but they won?t go around judging and belittling. good guys know girls have feelings and desires for acceptance the same as they do.

when people say mean shit it hurts no matter what. knowledge is power. know why the random dude tries to hurt you is because he?s pathetic. know a good guy when you meet one.
