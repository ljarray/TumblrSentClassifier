
Let's talk about how difficult it is to be a thick girl in modern society.
So, imagine you have your arms outstretched and there are two different people on each hand, either person representing one extremely opinionated group. One says ?yes I love your curves and your soft spots yes thick thighs save lives good for you and your booty,? and then the other group on the other side is saying, ?ugh body fat is fucking disgusting, how DARE you wear anything that shows skin and allows your jiggly parts to show, are you kidding you?re disgusting? so it?s like how tf are we supposed to feel? Because when one group starts to tug, it hurts!! And THEN we have those people that LOVE to inform you that ?you?re not thick, you?re just fat,? which is an AWESOME confidence booster, let me just say. So it?s like, sometimes I look in the mirror and say ?damn I look amazing right now!? And then other times it?s like ?welp I can never eat ever again,? because you?re right in the middle of the two extremes of body types, so it seems like EVERYBODY has an opinion. Maybe humans just want what we can?t have???
