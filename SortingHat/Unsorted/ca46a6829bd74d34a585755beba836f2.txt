
Day 11 Whole 90
I�m so happy I made it 11 days�sober�I know it�s weird to refer to a food addiction as a real addiction, but that�s exactly what it is, an addiction. I am addicted to processed foods and crappy foods and not real food because of the way the chemicals in the food react in my brain. They create a false high so gripping that you think all your problems will go away with just one bite. So I�ve been binge free, crappy food free, shitty health free for 11 days. I�ve been sober 11 days and it feels amazing.

On Whole 30(90) you aren�t supposed to weigh yourself. In the past ones I�ve done I�ve broken this rule after two weeks and it wasn�t till I was surfing the forums on the webpage that I realized the no weighing rule is as important as the no dairy rule. So this time around I�m not wavering from that diatribe this time. I might weigh myself at the end of each 30 days, but I also kind of want to wait till the 90 days. I think I might. We�ll see.

But I�ve been focusing much more on the non scale victories. It�s been 11 days and these are the things that have changed so far:

* better sleep. Usually I wake up every few hours to pee, now I wake up after six hours, pee, and can sleep for another two and not feel gross when I wake up.

* lower resting heart rate. Two weeks ago it was 98 when I was just sitting and now it�s 86!

* less fluffy puffy body looking back at me. I feel smaller.

* rosy cheeks! I look alive now.

* and the best part. I was getting super swollen feet two weeks ago at work, and even a little bit last week. My feet would swell and I�d come home with deep red lines from my shoes in my skin. But yesterday I came home with faint lines, no redness, and no pain in my feet.

Gentle cardio is sometimes sad. I really miss lifting, but doing this Whole 90 is slowly teaching me how to be more patient. I have to let myself heal before I can go do the things I love again. I also do not want to do a powerlifting competition. I want to lift and do cardio for my health. To be more human. To be better. And that�s why I think I�m going to go back to CrossFit in September. That was the only time I got this competition thrill, kept my heart healthy, and got the muscles I like. I want to get back into running. I want to do it all but I don�t want to be so extreme with it all. I want to just be a better me for me by me.
