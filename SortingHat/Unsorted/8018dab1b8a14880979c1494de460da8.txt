How to Lose Belly Fat Fast
How to Lose Belly Fat Fast

&nbsp; Today I will give you a way to lose your belly fat. And with the explanation, I�ll tell you exactly how to start. This is a very simple strategy. In fact, it is so simple that most people who read and decide to take any action that is not for them. They will continue to look for the special diet, supplements, weight loss or a combination of the �secret� exercises that will help you lose belly fat. Most suffer from �paralysis by analysis�, feeling so confused by all the different ideas and theories that end up doing nothing. So I will not promise a magic solution, because it seems that every website on nutrition and exercise seems to be these days, because it does not exist. No snappy three-letter abbreviations (TLA), the methods of training �underground� or secret to burn belly fat �well kept� apart � just a proven strategy results. So if tomorrow I woke up, looked in the mirror and I saw a big fat belly in front of me, that�s what I would do to get rid of it as fast as possible .. Step # 1. I first with a pen and a piece of paper and write down exactly how I wanted my body change. It would be a target, �results-based� as drop 30 pounds of fat or bark 5 inches off my waist. I also want to find a picture of how I wanted to see and put it on my bathroom mirror so I could see every day. Step # 2. Then I installed a number of objectives �process-based� like eating X number of calories per day, exercise for a total of 200 minutes per week, eat at least 500 grams of fruit and vegetables per day, and so on. So I would like to create a daily checklist and mark each target at the end of the day. My goal would be 90% compliance. So if there were 5 goals per day, have 35 goals each week (5 x 7 = 35). A rate of 90% compliance means I have 32 ticks each week. Step # 3. I would like to resistance training 3 days per week. This will help to improve your body composition in two main ways: First, a well-designed program of training, you burn calories and fat () during and after your workout. Second, if you do not do some type of resistance exercise while you�re dieting, a lot of weight you lose will come from muscle as well as fat. I would not worry if called metabolic resistance training, the formation of hormone resistance, or any other fancy names that people use to �dress� the old methods of training and pass them off as something again. The routine is based on squats, deadlifts, pull-ups rows (or pulldowns) and presses using repetitions (or less) heavy and low weight (8). I also included some work supersets and high repetition. Each workout should take about 45 minutes. I would use a resistor that was available � barbells and dumbbells, barbells, sandbags, fixed resistance machines, my own weight � to do the job. Step # 4. Then I would add a bit of cardio. Part of this is interval training, and part of it is good old �vanilla� steady state cardio. I make sure that I was training at least five days a week. Step # 5. I am a simple diet. To avoid having to count calories at every meal, I�m the Board Burn the Fat Feed the author Tom Venuto and create a number of different meal plans muscle. �If you are bored of eating the same thing every day,� said Tom, �can create multiple menus, or just exchange foods using your menu as a template. With this method, you simply count calories once when you create your menus. � I would start by creating six meals � two breakfasts, two lunches and two dinners. So I come with a couple of different sandwiches that were portable and quick and easy to do. Something as simple as an apple and a handful of nuts would do the job very well. Every day, I would just �take and toss� my meal plans, which stopped me getting bored of eating the same thing every day. And if I ate out a lot, or just not bother to plan my meals, I am these three simple rules of nutrition, the last two coming courtesy qualification Jill Coleman (Metabolic Effect fame). .. A. Eggs for breakfast. Two. Lunch is always a salad and a sandwich ever. Three. Dinner is always protein and vegetables. Step # 6. I would not worry about the glycemic index, eating six small meals a day, do not eat carbs after [INSERT YOUR favorite HERE mythical time day], the effect of certain foods on my insulin levels, or one of the other details of minor issue even half of what some people say they do not. Step # 7. Allow me a few free meals each week, probably on the weekend, I want to take some of my favorite foods. Step # 8. I check my progress on a weekly basis. Although I measure my body composition, do not be a slave of results (especially since most body composition testing widely available are notoriously inaccurate). I would be more interested in the way he looked at me in the mirror, my strength levels in the gym and how my own clothes. I also adapts things every week or two depending on the results that I got. When I realized that my pace of fat loss has slowed, for example, I would make some adjustments to my intake of calories and then evaluate the results. I remain committed to my goal while remaining flexible in the approach used to reach it. Step # 9. I would be patient. I would not have unrealistic expectations, like losing 25 pounds of fat in 25 days. I also agree that there is an �upper limit� on the rate at which fat can be lost. For this reason, my rate of fat loss will gradually slow down the more I got to my goal. Thus, in the early stages of my program, I could be losing 3 pounds of fat per week. But as I closed my goal weight, I�d be happy with maybe 0.1 pounds of fat loss per week. Step # 10. And then I sit and watch the fall of the belly fat.
