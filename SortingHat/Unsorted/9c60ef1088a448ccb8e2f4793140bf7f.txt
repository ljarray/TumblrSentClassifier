
weigh in Wednesday + motivation
Okay guys, so if you�ve been keeping up with my blog you would know that my birthday was on the fourth of July and from the 4th to the 10th I binged on nothing but birthday cake and chocolate. I didn�t even dare weigh myself last Wednesday because I knew it wasn�t going to be good. So on the 11th to 15th (today) I�ve started eating clean again and going to the gym every morning. Today I woke up and weighted in and I had lost 1 pound. Since I ate like crap for a while I didn�t expect to see a huge (positive) change in my weight. So my starting weight was 138 pounds and today I weighted in at 133.2pounds. I�m not mad that I eat bad for those days. I felt so sluggish and tired when I was eating like that and I take it as a learning experience. 23 more pound to go! I know I can do it. I hope everyone is doing well with whatever journey they are on. If you mess up a day (or almost a week like me) DONT GIVE UP!!! If anyone every needs advice or motivation please feel free to send me a message! I personally am doing this journey completely alone, meaning I�m going to the gym by myself and I�m really the only one in my family and work that eating clean, so I know how hard it can be to stick with it and stay positive. I love you all and stay positive <3
