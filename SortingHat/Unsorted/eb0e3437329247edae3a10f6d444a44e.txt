
We Bare Bears Review
Just watched We Bare Bears and I love it! Just a quick commentary on the characters:
1. Grizzly: I like how he is outgoing, supportive, and adventurous. The show does really well pointing out the fact that he plays the �main leading role� among the 3 bears. His personality helps balance out the next 2 bears such as the following;

2. Panda: although hesitant about many of Grizzly�s outlandish decisions, Panda has every opportunity to explore the world around him. He absolutely has to have his phone near him or he freaks out! This kind of behavior is understandable due to the fact that I (and most other smartphone users) would be the same way. Last but not least is one of my favorite bears;

3. Icebear: �Icebear for president� (quote from the episode Viral Video). I absolutely love Icebears� chill personality (no pun intended). He seems to be some sort of secret ninja bear because he has ninja stars, he is concerned about training, he has minimal facial expressions, and he keeps calm, even during stressful situations. Icebear doesn�t talk much. But when he does talk, he uses third person and says around 3-5 words after that.

Overall, the show is great and I highly recommend watching it! There is probably more to review concerning this show (like the pros and cons of the show in its entirety); but, since it just came out, I will keep watching new episodes.

Until then, feel free to add anything you saw in this show that I did not. Thanks! 
(By the way, Icebear for president is a great idea!)
