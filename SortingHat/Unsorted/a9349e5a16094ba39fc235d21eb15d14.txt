Fat shaming/acceptance. It�s a big topic here in the fitblr universe and I�ve seen many discussions and points of view on it. And here�s what I have to say from my personal experience.

I don�t like this whole fat acceptance movement. Yes I said it, I don�t like it.

I don�t like it because I know the pain that overweight people are going through. I know the struggle that comes with choosing what to eat. I know the that overwhelming urge to eat all of the food and how hard it is overcome it. I know that demon. I am that person.

But what my counselor has been trying to get through to me is self worth. And I never really got it. I liked who I was and thought I was overall happy. How could I have a problem with self worth? But she is right. Because if I really felt love and worth for myself, I would be making healthier choices. How could I truly care about myself, if I chose to slowly kill my body with food. That isn�t a way to treat someone you love.

So when I say that I don�t like fat acceptance, it�s because I don�t want people to accept that. I don�t want people to accept that the self worth and love that they think they are feeling is enough. Because it isn�t. I want them to want more for themselves. I want them to strive to reach an even greater sense of happiness.

I am working toward this right now. I haven�t been doing this for long, but I am seeing my body in ways I never did before. I am treating my body in a new way. I�m not only makings healthier choices to become thinner, but because my body DESERVES the best. Because I love my body enough to let it work the way it was suppose to work. To use the muscles the way they were meant to be used. To give each and every part of my body a chance to be utilized. Because it deserves it.

So don�t accept the fat me. Don�t accept the unhealthy choices I make. Don�t accept the muscles on my body that have been sitting dormant for years. Push me to be the best. Push me to make the choices that are right for my body. Push me to TRULY have love for my body.
