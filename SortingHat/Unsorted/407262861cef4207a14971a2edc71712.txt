
??????Day 6 & 7??????
Fell asleep last night before I could post so I�m putting the two days together!

Day Six- Do you binge? If so, explain why you think you do.

JFC binge eating kills me. That�s honestly how I�ve gained so much weight back. My boyfriend works for a company where he is constantly having to go off on stints away from me for weeks or sometimes months at a time,           (he makes hella money but it�s still hard on us both) and when I don�t see him for a while I get this massive urge to just eat all the time to make myself feel better. But this past week that I have been doing this challenge I haven�t binged at all and I am so so so proud of myself! 


Day Seven- Do your parents know you�re trying to lose weight? Do they care? 

I�m actually in a really good situation right now. I�m not living with my parents  because I�m staying with my boyfriends family for the summer, and the best part is they keep leaving on week long vacations so I have the whole house to myself. This makes it so much better because I don�t have to deal with the pressure of outside food. Back home I could never accomplish this diet because my mom was constantly making comments about how thin I was and how needed to eat more. (FYI this was when I was still 130-5, so it wasn�t even true, it was just my crazy momma needing to feed me up because she�s just an uber caring person)
