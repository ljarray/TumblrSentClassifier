As requested by an anon, here are some easy vegan meal ideas! I�m also working on making separate posts with more detailed meals - e.g. a post dedicated just to vegan breakfasts, one to lunches and dinners, and one for snacks. Keep an eye out in the coming days!

These are some meals that I eat on the reg - they�re mostly high carb low fat (but not all! They can be as HCLF as you choose), very easy to make, no complicated ingredients etc. As I mentioned above, more detailed posts to come, but in the meantime check out my �Recipes� and �My Vegan Eats� tabs!

Breakfast 
Smoothies, porridge (oatmeal), overnight oats, pancakes, fruit monomeals/salads, cereal w fresh fruit and coconut yoghurt, smoothie bowls, nicecream, toast w toppings, fresh juice, granola w soy milk and fruit.
