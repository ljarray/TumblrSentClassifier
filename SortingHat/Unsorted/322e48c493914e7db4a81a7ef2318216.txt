
Day 39: No use crying over mashed potatoes
So today I got my wisdom teeth out!!

The pain isn�t too bad and it gives me an excuse to eat one of my favorite foods, mashed potatoes. I stated crying when the nurse told my mom I could eat them (I was on the pain medication but I probably would have cried if I was to be completely honest).

So I asked the doctor before hand when I could start working out again, and he said give it a couple days and see how I feel, so unfortunately I wasn�t able to exercise at all today, nor will I be able to for the next couple of days.

I was gonna try on Friday though to at least something, like easy yoga or some at home strength training.

Breakfast:
Sleep

Lunch:
Chicken noodle soup 
Blue Gadorade

Snack: 
Mango white grape juice 
A slice of cheese

Dinner: 
Mashed potatoes 
Blue Gadorade

Dessert: 
Strawberry frozen yogurt

I�m not gonna even put how many steps I took today because I was on the couch not moving for 90% of my day.

I hope you all had a great day and managed to be more active than I was haha!

Love, Jenna ??
