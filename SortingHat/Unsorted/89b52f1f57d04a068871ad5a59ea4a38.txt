
laying in bed right now legs are sore! But like good sore for the work out I did today, I�ve eaten good today, I�ve drank good today! I�m excited to see what progress I have made :)

I also didn�t eat 1 bit of meat today which is good news! & even though I thought about having a Starbucks chocolate thing I didn�t! & I didn�t have dessert either I�m feeling pretty damn proud of myself tonight :) super good progress..

For the rest of this week I�m going to keep working hard & I�m going to keep make up free.. take extra good care of my skin..

I need to look up meat free healthy meals to inspire me for the week a head.

Going to try focus more on my arm exercises tomorrow as my legs really are sore! Haha.

Feeling proud :)
