
Thin Again
I post pictures of skinny women on Tumbler called thinspo. It started when I was fourteen and wanted to purge, but I had no idea how to. I went to google for answers, which led me to a list of �Pro Ana� site or Pro anorexia and pro bulimia or �Pro Mia�. I was never successful that night, I have always hated throwing up any way. Instead through those sites I learned how to starve and eat less calories. I saw results but non that I wanted. I never got to the point of looking anorexic, my problem was eating less until I couldn�t take it but most of the time I ate to cover my habits. I would take laxatives, chew and spit, and over exercise. About a year ago I finally was able to purge, the thing about that was I could binge and purge and maintain my wight when I was stressed or through the holidays. But I�ve been trying so hard not to do that, but I still will eat fatty unhealthy food out of stress. At the moment I'am trying to get out of that cycle. My goal is to eat less calories again and workout for and hour four to five days a week. 
I'am tired of feeling rolls on my stomach when I sit, tired of struggling to get into my jeans, and tired of what I see in the mirror. When I turn to the side I look like a potato, tired of feeling my body jiggle when I run. I want to have a feeling of emptiness in my stomach, I feel like I achieved something when I do especially when I go to bed hungry. I know that I will wake up thinner. I�m sick of feeling the wight of my body with every step I take. I want to feel lighter.
