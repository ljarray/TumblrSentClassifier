
Looking in the mirror
Actually liking what you see
Feeling confidence flowing
Wearing what you want
Just because you can
You?ve worked hard
Getting to where you are
But just one comment
Can tip you back there
Can drain that confidence
Can make you hate what you see
When you look in the mirror
