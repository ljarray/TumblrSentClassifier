I hate this hashtag, I hate that so many have been through this. I know I for one, have never felt anything but hate for myself and my body because of the way my weight has been seen as a measure of how worthless I am.

I remember when my Mum saw that I had a stretch mark, I remember her distain and warnings about eating anything deemed ?inappropriate? from then on. I was about 11.
I remember being shown some yoga poses by a family friend, and my Dad pointing out how my belly hung down very loudly in front of the whole room. I was 10 at most.

These are memories that I will have forever, that will forever have an impact on how I see my body. I only hope we can stop treating children with such distain.
