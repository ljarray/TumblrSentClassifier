
All the people who follow me
Stay awesome. 
Drink your water. 
Maybe go for a walk/run/what ever sort of physical activity you wanna do. Just keep the healthy stuff goin on. 
Watch some YouTube. 
Go get something to eat if you�re hungry.
Go hug your pet. If you don�t have a (huggable) pet, go hug a family member. Living on your own? I don�t know�call up a friend and give them a phone hug. 
Do your damn dishes/laundry, don�t let them just sit until it�s too much work. 
Help your friend do their homework/chores/whatever. That what friends are for. 
Take a break when you�re done with what you need to do and chillax. (Shut up, �chillax� is the first thing that came to mind)
Now you�ve just help yourself and/or someone else.

You gonna tell me you�re worthless now?
