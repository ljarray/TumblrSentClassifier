
Day 6: Do you binge? If so, explain why you think you do.
I have binged before and its possibly one of the worst feelings afterward emotionally for me. I think I just start to get impatient with weight loss and give up a little bit so I just let loose and eat all the bad stuff in the kitchen making me feel absolutely horrible about myself.However, I havent binged in a while keeping that in mind and hopefully I wont again because I hate the feeling after.
