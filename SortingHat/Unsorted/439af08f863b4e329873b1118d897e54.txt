Being a strait white man who is conventionally attractive is becoming increasingly interesting.
My skin is Irish. My eyes and my cheekbones are Native American. My appetite is Hispanic. My nose is Italian. My ears are Welsh. My feet are Egyptian. My hands are German. I am a mutt, mixed race, but predominantly white. I?m cisgender, heterosexual, Caucasian and basically everything else ?social justice warriors? on this website like to attack. These are things I cannot control. But don?t I deserve the same right to be proud of my body? Proud of my mixed heritage? Proud of all the nations and peoples whose genes I carry? Just because I have ?privilege? does not mean I deserve to be torn down so you can feel taller.
