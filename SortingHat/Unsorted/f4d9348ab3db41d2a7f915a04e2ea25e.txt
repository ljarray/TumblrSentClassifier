

So Im actually really scared to post this, since Im not really a fitness/health blog. 
I guess this is my first before & during!
The left was taking back in November, I was a freshman in college. I was finally on my own and let myself forget how much I loved my body and how I loved my healthy lifestyle before.
The right, was taking 10 minutes ago. Same shirt, same leggings. 8 months apart. I havent been putting in real effort until lately. I struggled with my ED through these past months, but Iï¿½ve been choosing recovery. Ive made it my priority to be happy and healthy, like I know I can be. 
Ive been so discouraged lately, but looking at these comparisons, Im ecstatic for my future.
Thank you to everyone who has encouraged me and supported me along the way, Im not done yet!
