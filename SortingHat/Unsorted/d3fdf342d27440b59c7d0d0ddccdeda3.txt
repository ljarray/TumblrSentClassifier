
Random story time

My friend in 6th grade used to make fun of my because she thought my boobs were smaller than hers, but this thing is, mine are much bigger than hers, but I was shy and didn?t want anyone to see so I always wore baggy clothes
I walked her home one time and it was windy so my shirt pressed against my chest and she wouldn?t stop talking about their size since she was so surprised, but she never apologized for teasing me and calling me names like ?pancake chest? or ?cherry tits?
Now she just makes fun of how big they are and in public as well 
I wore jackets to school everyday to try and cover them, I was so ashamed and to shy to stand up or tell anyone

Moral is, don?t you dare harass anyone for their body type and if someone makes fun of you for your physical appearance, stand up to them or find someone who can
