
Womyn: Released
Her thighs applaud the stride in her step

That makes body come alive

Makes her curls bounce and fly- 

aways run to keep up

Makes no paint bring Picasso to shame

Cause personality gleams

brighter than mascara

Masks ain?t pretty

And her stripes

are her battle scars

Makes concealer look

weak

like the hand that can?t grasp 

sleek dangerously bold curves

They?re too much for 

the common 

Common denominators don?t

exist for her 

She?s a gladiator

fighting the nonsense that

made her shy

made her angry

made her hide behind

filters and liquor 

Insecurities made her sicker

but she fought that shit

and finally

she?s beginning

to love

her reflection
