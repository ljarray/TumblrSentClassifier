I didn�t liked having pictures where I�m not posing with my arms, looking my good angles, sticking in my stomach, making my legs look smaller, I always erase the pictures where I wasn�t making me look good, but lately I haven�t, lately I�m okay with this pictures, also I was smiling because my mom was making me laugh, idk, it feels good to come to peace with a natural picture.
