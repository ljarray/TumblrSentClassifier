Ok so I did not want to become one of THOSE people� You know the one who drives everyone crazy with their non-stop food pics (although I LOVE peoples food pics) and going on and on about how wonderful they feel, and how this whole clean eating 21 day fix deal turned my life totally around (I love hearing how awesome my friends are doing) BUT I AM that person now.

I LOVE this new clean eating�
