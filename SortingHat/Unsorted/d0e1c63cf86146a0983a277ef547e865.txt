
I?m really beautiful! I?m gonna try really hard to keep reframing the way I see myself in the mirror and in photos. It?s really hard because I?m still dealing with general body image issues that I?ve always had but especially hard because I really don?t want to see myself and my body as a man, but it?s been really interesting to try really reframing it myself. 

Like so far in my personal transition it?s been about me reframing my role in society and my actions and my presentation as not-a-man (and recently trying to see that as a woman), but I haven?t really tried to really reframe my body as it is. Not that I?m totally closing my options off to maybe doing HRT some day (the thought really excites me but also doesn?t seem like it might be what I ultimately want), but I think I can do a lot of positive changes for myself by reframing the way that I look at my body right now. Every part of it. Individually just looking at parts of my body and my body as a whole as gendered in the way that I want it to be. It?s so interesting to do that?
