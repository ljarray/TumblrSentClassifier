
�I waited so long for someone to come along that would love every part of me. The whole, the pretty, the shiny. The cracked, the chipped, the broken. I thought that I could finally find happiness and contentment in that. 
But then, one day, I realized that it had to come from me first. I had to learn to love and accept myself in all my messiness and all my brilliance; all my brokenness and all my wholeness. It had to happen, right then, right there. Only then would joy follow.
Nobody else�s love for you can substitute or replace the love that you must have for yourself. If you rely solely on the acceptance and approval of others, you will never feel truly fulfilled, satisfied, or happy. Start today. Start now. Love yourself the way you want to be loved by someone else.�
