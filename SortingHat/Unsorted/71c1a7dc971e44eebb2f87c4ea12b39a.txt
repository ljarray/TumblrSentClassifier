
Pregnancy and body image.
During my first pregnancy I really hated my body. I previously worked really hard to lose 45 pounds and although I was gaining weight for the best reason, it was so hard to see it that way. Last year I had a very complicated miscarriage that required a low dosage form of chemotherapy to get my body back to normal. I think that definitely changed the way I see myself this time and make sure not to take any bit of this experience for granted.

I see so many people beat themselves up over their bodies while pregnant and trust me, I hear you guys. I just wish it was more human nature to see what our bodies are capable of and not just what they look like on the outside. We deserve to embrace our bodies no matter the size. Just want you all to know that you are beautiful. No matter what!
