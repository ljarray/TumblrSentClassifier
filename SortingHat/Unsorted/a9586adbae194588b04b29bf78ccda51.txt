The zoo claimed she faked her pregnancy to get into an air-conditioned room�

If this title doesn�t crack you up I don�t know what will. tiptaptap

So what happens is that Yuanyuan, a female panda given to Taiwan by Mainland China along with Tuantuan the male panda, has been showing physical signs of pregnancy. The zoo immediately put her in a single room and served her good food and just generally making her living condition better so she can give birth to a healthy baby.

Yuanyuan had her first baby in 2013 so she had been through this process before.

And now they realized that her pregnancy was fake, the zoo goes off to say that she faked it because she knew it�d serve her well in the tropical summer.


For a less emotionally-charged report on the matter, see here. I haven�t found an English article that says the same thing yet but I just have to put it up here.

What a bamf xD
