I?ve had so much to eat recently like I?m just eating tons and honestly i don?t care. for the first time I?m not hating on myself for eating and it feels sorta nice. Like today I had a hamburger and ice cream and now I?m eating a cookie and I feel full and plump and happy wow let?s see how long this will last :-)
