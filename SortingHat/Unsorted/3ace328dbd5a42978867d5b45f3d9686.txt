My name is Danielle & I run the blog little-miss-curvy 

At seven years old,  I learned to look at my body with disgust and not love.  I remember being told by dad that if I didn�t stop eating like I did I was going to be as big as a house, and he only told me this because he use to weigh 300+ pounds and he knew what it felt like to be that big. I learned to not be okay with sharing my clothing size with people from my mother because I wasn�t at the size I should be, I was bigger.  I learned to hide food and fear being caught eating after I had already ate, because it was shameful to be hungry. 

At twenty one years old,  I learned that being �big� is not the worst thing that can happen to me. I learned that my size shouldn�t make me any less proud. I�ve learned that food shouldn�t be feared & it�s not shameful to eat.

 I�ve learned to look at my body with love and not disgust, because anything that can carry me through the years of self hatred & abuse and still come out beautiful is something that cannot be looked at with disgust.

This is for any person out there who has been told that being big isn�t beautiful, that being fat or having fat is something to be ashamed of because in people�s minds, you shouldn�t be that size. This is for anyone who has felt even remotely shamed for their weight or size, for anyone who has felt shamed for their everything. 

Big is beautiful, fat is fabulous, and we�re all hella cute :~)
