
Attempt #2
Hi everyone, sorry i stopped with my food diary but something happened after eating that oreo storm and i basically, well, gave up? Not as in �oh no i miss ice-cream i wanna get back to my old life� but more �what�s the harm in eating a burger?� or �just one more� and let me tell you, that was the first step to going back to my old habits. 

So here i am again; trying again. i made a mistake but there�s always time to improve on yourself. 

This time, i will be sticking to a diet shake (Nature�s Way Slimright Accelerator Program, chocolate flavour). it proposes of a meal plan as follows:

Breakfast: Slimright diet shake

Morning tea: fruit

Lunch: Slimright diet shake

Afternoon tea: Slimright protein bar (substitute: muesli bar)

Dinner: balanced meal (less than 500 calories)

Dessert: nuts 

Caloric intake goal: 1200 

*drink plenty of water and exercise for better results



I�m allowed to switch up the meals but i must always have 2x Slimright diet shakes in a day. For exercise, I�m planning on taking my dog on walks and yoga. Water is not a problem (as you can see from previous entries). Feel free to go on the diet with me and message me so we can help each other out!
