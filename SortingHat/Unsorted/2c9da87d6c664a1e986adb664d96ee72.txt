
Can I propose a movement? If you ever find yourself in the unfortunate event of having one of your selfies reblogged to a fat hate blog, go to their blog and block their asses, first of all. Then scroll through their blog and if there are any other girls who have been reblogged by them with nasty comments, just send them a message. Let them know that they�re beautiful and kind of balance out the hate that they received earlier. It doesn�t take very long and it honestly makes such a huge difference. I mean, we all know how awful you can feel about yourself after you get hit with something like that and wouldn�t you have wanted someone to stop and let you know that you�re still beautiful when it happened to you? It�s all of our jobs to help our fellow fat beauties who are being bullied by shitty little nitwits on the Internet. We have to stick together!
