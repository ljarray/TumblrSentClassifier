
I read so many things warning me that I was going to be super weak after surgery and that I would need straws in all my drinks because I wouldn?t be able to lift the glasses, that I should get other people to pick up books for me, etc

but I?m fine?? I can?t open doors from certain angles and I definitely can?t lift my arms up too far, but I can absolutely lift a glass glass full of ice water without engaging my chest muscles (or even really my upper arm muscles?) in any way. it doesn?t hurt or feel like it?s pulling things in a bad way at all. 

idgi. am I just mysteriously stronger than everyone else who?s had top surgery and blogged advice about it? I definitely get tired much more quickly than before, and some tasks, like emptying my drains, sometimes require me to sit down briefly partway through, but generally I don?t feel as motion-limited or weak as I expected I was going to
