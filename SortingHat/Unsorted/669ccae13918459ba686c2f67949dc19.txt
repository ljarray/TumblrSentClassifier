
So apparently yoga is painfulï¿½ Although being very sore doesnt help xD
After an hour of yoga I had some brown rice and grilled chicken for lunch.
Had a hamburger for dinner after which I went for a walk. It was only 2.5 miles but its been a while x). I def couldve gone longer but didnt have the time. Afterwards I had a salad of lettuce cucumbers and avacado.
Hopefully Im not as sore tomorrow ??
