Here�s me at the ocean in Boston. This picture makes me giggle a little bit because, next to the ocean, I look SO SMALL, but I�ve gone through my whole life feeling like and being told that I�m HUGE. In the terms of society, I�m big. I�m fat. And that is totally OK by me. But in the grand scheme of this planet, I am incredibly tiny; there are oceans, volcanos, entire other galaxies that could swallow me up.

This story will sound kind of strange, but I learned about body positivity from hating my body. I�ve been overweight � obese even � my entire life. Much of my immediate and extended family is obese. I�ve come to accept that I was genetically pre-disposed (nature), and I grew up with parents who had been struggling with their weight their entire lives which is where I learned my binging, stress eating, and dieting habits (nurture). 

About two years ago, I decided that I was tired of depression and anxiety; self-hatred was incredibly exhausting. I was set on the fact that losing weight would mean being happy. If I was skinnier � if I was �normal� � everything would be better. I decided to have weight loss surgery and have lost 130 pounds. 

I�m not going to lie: being physically healthier* does give me more energy. Drinking more water and eating more fresh foods help me feel better mentally too. But, after a few months of resounding weight loss success, I still hated myself. There was still a voice in my head telling me I was fat which meant I was worthless. Half of that�s true: I AM fat. I own that. I love my body! But I am FAR from worthless.


Losing weight didn�t fix all my problems, and that�s what I was banking on. So what now? I decided I needed to work on loving my body, which is when I got involved with the body positivity movement. I hardly claim to be an expert because I�m on this journey too! Learning to love and accept yourself is a process, and it�s often not linear. You may take 3 steps forward and then 4 steps back. You may be stuck for months � or years � struggling with ONE thing about you. But it�s all worth it: any progress is good progress.

My weight � and your weight � do not dictate your health, your worth, or your overall well-being. It does not dictate who will love you, who will respect you, or what your life will be.





And your fitness journey � or lack their of � does not make your story more or less important.

If you are losing, maintaining, or gaining weight; if you haven�t stepped on a scale in 5 years and you feel liberated; if you want to run a marathon or just take a flight of stairs without feeling winded; if you want to go vegetarian or get over your fear of broccoli �





you are worthy of happiness, you and your FAT BEAUTIFUL SELF.
