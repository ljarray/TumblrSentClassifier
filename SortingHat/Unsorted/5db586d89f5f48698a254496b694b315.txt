
Day 27: Busy Bees ??
So today I was swamped! I barely got anything done today because I had all these things to do and errands to run, which meant I sat in the car all day driving around instead actually walking.

I didn�t even get to go to the gym which threw my whole day off. I feel awful honestly. Tomorrow I�m gonna get up and try to go to a yoga class cause it�s been a minute since I took one.

I hope you all had a better, more relaxed day, than I did! Tell me about it!

Boston Cream pie yogurt 
A cup of black coffee
