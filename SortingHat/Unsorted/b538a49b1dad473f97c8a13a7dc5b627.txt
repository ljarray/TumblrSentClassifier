
My throat burns from vodka
My scars on my wrists are fading
God i want them back
My abs hurt from the 77, wait no, 79 crunches
My thighs ache from the 67 squats in a row 
My arms hurt from holding up all my weight during a 2 minute plank
My stomach hurts from the restriction
Im dissy
Im weak
Standing takes all my energy
But its all worth it
To go through this every day from now until im perfect
Its worth it because i will be pale and thin
Its worth it for the hip bones
The collar bones
The cheek bones
Its worth it because I�ll look good in practically everything
I dont want to be able to count my ribs
No, nothing like that
Just to be thin enough for �him� to notice me
For him to smile and say those things i adore
Just enough to be described as delicate 
Just enough to be pretty again
