
fall in love with yourself. force it. tell yourself you�re amazing, you�re hot shit, even if you don�t think it�s true. make faces in the mirror, dance, have silly fun by yourself. if you repeatedly tell yourself you�re the shit, that no one can touch you, that you�re the hottest babe in all the earth and you�re able to goof around when you�re alone, you�re eventually going to believe it�s all true and see that you are independent and don�t need others to validate you. you will begin to love yourself.
