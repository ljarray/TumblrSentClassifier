
Sorry I?m on mobile but to answer sailorsweetpeach ? s question about if skinny people can cosplay fat characters, to my understanding is largely that yes anyone can cosplay anyone. I just think that skinny people/white people/abled people need to be cogniscent of the fact that there SO much representation for privileged bodies and so little (especially positive) representation for everyone else.

When I get back on a computer I?ll add some links to where I got this position from.
