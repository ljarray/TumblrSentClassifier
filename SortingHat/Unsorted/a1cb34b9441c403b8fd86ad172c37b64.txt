Okay, hold up. Where the fuck in this post did I say ?I hate thin girls???? Nowhere. I would never hate someone just because of their body size. Shaming someone for their weight is pathetic. But guess what! Media does it to us everyday! There?s only one body type glorified in media, while the other is shamed.

And you?re always leaving us out of your ?body positivity?:


So yeah, excuse me for wanting to spread some body positivity for bigger girls; because what media doesn?t tell you, is that they?re beautiful too. Fuck you.
