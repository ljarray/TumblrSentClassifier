
Fall Then Get Back Up
There are days when we stumble, and then days when we completely fall flat on our faces. Some stay down, and some get up and keep going. I�ll admit when it came to weight loss I would always do the first. Fall and give up. I would have the mindset that when I fell there was no way to get up again. Depressing right? It was. I�ve changed though.

Last night I gave myself a wake up call. I needed to. I had to remind myself I was doing something that was working, but I had to be more disciplined than I was. Being more disciplined didn�t mean starting over, like I always thought it did. It just meant learning, and then improving.

Being on a weight loss journey is always going to be difficult. No matter what the parameters are. You can be as disciplined, and as determined as you want, but there will be times where you stumble or fall. It took years for me to realize that falling was just a part of the journey. Nothing more.

If there�s anyone reading this, and is on the same journey as I am, message me. We�ll talk. Whatever you feel you need to speak about, just message me. Take care & never give up!
