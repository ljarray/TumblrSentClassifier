
Thank you.

In my wildest dreams I never wouldï¿½ve thought that anybody (let alone 73 of you living, breathing fat-hearted weirdos) would even consider reading the whiny rants that are my posts and weight-loss occurrences, but hey, I thank you all the same.

Thank you for reading, commenting and (to some of you) sending me really odd questions in my inbox regarding weight loss and what not. I really do appreciate it, and it makes me smile every time someone comments on the things I write. 

Needless to say, it does give me a huge boost of motivation to keep writing and posting interesting things (debatable) of my day and the annoying nuisances that I see/meet/kick on an everyday basis.

:)
