
I want to talk to people who have pretty bad scoliosis and are in relationships. I want to know how you overcame the negative feelings towards your body. I just can?t even contemplate allowing somebody to touch me because I?m so embarrassed about my body. I honestly truly feel like nobody will ever view me romantically because of my physical form. Please message me if you have any advice or inspiration for my pathetic soul to grab on to.
