
sorry i?m on my phone and can?t do a read more post so tw: body image distress, weight talk (no numbers), eating habits and food mentions

?..


i feel really disgusting and awful about my body today and also i have no energy at all and i know it?s because i have not been sleeping or feeding myself properly (all i eat is cheese, bread, and chocolate) and i know that the body changes i?m experiencing are not permanent because bodies change and fluctuate all the time and also my body knows where it?s supposed to be in terms of weight/shape/size better than i do so i?m trying to trust it and listen to its cues but it?s hard to do that when you catastrophize every little change and convince yourself it?s the end of the world and that life won?t go in if you?re x amount of weight more than you?re comfortable with/used to. but guess what! no one notices tiny changes except me! and even if they did notice it doesn?t matter! my worth is not based on 1) my body?s relationship to clothes and gravity 2) how other people perceive my body 3) how much i love/hate my body. my relationship with my body is difficult and layered in trauma and i don?t have to feel good about it all the time. it feels shitty right now to feel extremely uncomfortable but i?m grateful i can validate that shittiness for myself and also recognize that the ways i feel about my body are a result of greater issues and probably aren?t even about my body. so fuck it i feel shit about my body and i?m having a hard time accepting certain changes and i feel extremely panicked and anxious when i see myself in the mirror but i?m way healthier than i used to be and i?m not actively trying to change my body but instead i?m trying to sit with this discomfort and let it pass so ya that?s
Cool
