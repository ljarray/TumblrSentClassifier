
HIII Im Back!
I went to Universal Studios and the Fast and Furious ride was awesome (I like the speed). Then after one day of riding EVERYTHING except watching shows, we went home. The next morning, I had a day with NO phone, iPad Mini, and the personal iPad (They all died XD I used all their battery and I didn�t have internet for the iPad Mini to do some Tumblr during traveling so all I did is just draw. I didn�t go to Tumblr at the hotel bcuz my parents said no electronics during your summer vacation with family). Finally, I saw a show. We Bare Bears. I LOVE ALL OF THEM ALREADY, MOSTLY PANDA! So tommorrow night, I might reblog many We Bare Bears OK BYE IM GONNA WATCH SOME JACK AND MARK PLAYING FNAF 4
