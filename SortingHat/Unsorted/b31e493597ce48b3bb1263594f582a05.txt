My clean eating decision is going REALLY well. I feel a lot better, more energized and actually happier, but that is because I�m making more conscious choices. I killed it in aerial class today, got tons of moves I couldn�t do on Thursday. But then I tried this variation in cats cradle that was hard and required some major flexibility� and so I had Jasmine spot me, but I couldn�t get the move without ripping a huge fart that everyone heard� so I let them hear it. It was funny and embarrassing. I have a huge amount of work to do still for moving into my new house, but I got the keys. I�ll be busy with that all day tomorrow. Oh well.
