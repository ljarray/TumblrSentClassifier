Are you currently struggling to lose weight? Do you exercise regularly but still struggle to shake the pounds off? Have you hired a personal trainer but not seen the physical results you�re looking for? The struggle to lose and maintain weight loss is a problem for millions of people worldwide. But the solution may not be physical after all.

When embarking on a weight loss journey, people will often consult with personal trainers and nutritionists. The trainers will devise customized fitness programs to help you achieve strength, flexibility, stamina, and promote fat loss. Nutritionists will provide structured meal plans designed to create caloric deficits and help you shed the pounds safely.

With the exercise programs, your trainer will devise specific strength building exercises with recommendations for rep ranges and sets. Meanwhile a nutritionist ensures you�re getting the right amount of vital nutrients while still eating foods you enjoy � four ounces of tilapia with two cups squash and zucchini, and a large salad of mixed field greens. In other words, everything is carefully regimented.

But nowhere in the mix of this is psychological coaching, when in fact, psychological issues can be a key factor in why people struggle to lose weight.

Think about it. You�re paying someone to give you the right exercises and the right nutrition program. And if you follow those programs to a �T� you will succeed. But the problem isn�t in the fitness program or the nutrition plan. It�s the adherence to these programs and the psychological issues preventing adherence that can make or break your weight loss goals.

Are you an emotional eater in times of stress? Do you reach for a jar of peanut butter after a stressful day of work? Do you struggle finding the time to devote to yourself and fitting in workouts? Do you feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities as a single parent and don�t know how to be there for your children while still taking care of you?

These are all psychological-related issues that can impact your weight loss goals but are rarely addressed by traditional fat loss programs. A psychologist or psychotherapist with experience dealing with these issues can help you address them. You can learn what triggers you to binge eat and how taking a 20-minute afternoon walk or a painting class can help you to channel your stress in a more positive way.

A psychotherapist can help you learn to prioritize all areas of your life so you can devote time to your responsibilities while still taking care of you. You can also focus on goal setting, including setting small reasonable goals for yourself as you work your way towards your long-term goals. And this can be transferred to other areas of your life, including career, marriage, and family. Because that�s what this is truly about � treating the whole you!

Studies show that when psychological and behavioral issues are addressed during a weight loss program that people are far more likely to achieve and maintain long-term success. By finding a comprehensive fat loss program that incorporates all three of these aspects together: diet, exercise, and mental coaching, you stand an even higher rate of success because you are addressing all of the key components of making a lifestyle change. The cohesiveness here is truly the key.
