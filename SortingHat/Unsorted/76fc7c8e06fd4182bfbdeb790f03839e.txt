
I got my third Stitch Fix last night, and for whatever reason I just wasn?t excited by it? It was three tops, only one of which I?m into, a dress that felt boxy and unflattering but actually didn?t look terrible, and a skirt that I?m deciding whether I like or not. Generally disappointing, but I also feel like my body image has been pretty crummy lately, so that might have something to do with it. Also it?s so effing hot that any clothes that aren?t pajamas feel awful.
