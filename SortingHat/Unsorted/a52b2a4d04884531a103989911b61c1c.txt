
Eating: So Fresh, So Clean
I�m challenging myself to try at least one new vegan recipe a week. Last week I tried this one from the Minimalist Baker blog. I wasn�t sure I was going to like it because I couldn�t find the ingredients to make the tahini sauce and I thought it would be bland without it, but I was totally wrong! The recipe makes a ton, so I put the leftovers in a spinach wrap with hummus for lunch the next day.

This week I think I�m going to attempt two, depending on how crazy my work schedule is this week.

I�m upping my breakfast game with these PB vegan protein pancakes from, again from the Minimalist Baker. I mean, check these out:


And then for a dinner, I�m trying this carrot scramble from the cutest blog ever, The Vegan Stoner.


Cutest. Blog. Ever. Also, all the recipes look so doable.
