
Day three of the Whole30
so far not so bad. Had to cheat a tiny bit the first day because I had some cheese left and I hate wasting food. Yesterday I made an awesome dinner of grilled shrimp, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Thank�s to summer I can bbq most of my dinners! No withdrawals as of yet! I�ll be back in a couple of days to see how that goes. 



Wish me strength!
