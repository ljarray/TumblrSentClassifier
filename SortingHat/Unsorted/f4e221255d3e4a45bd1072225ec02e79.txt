Lately I?ve been seeing a lot of these post for brandy Melville and American apparel, of these super thin models. They?re not anorexic, nor extremely thin, but they?re petite. Seeing these beautiful models with tiny waits and long legs makes me constantly pay attention to my huge hips. My friends say I?ve got hips that could carry 5 children and my curve; my curves are always the thing they remark the most about me. I kept on taking this in a bad way. I felt big, chubby, like a had fat thighs and most of all I felt ugly. But lately I?ve come to the realization that I am beautiful no matter what. So what I don?t look like a brandy model? I look like freaking Beyonc?! Screw anybody who has ever told me I was ugly or fat, or that ever made me feel like I should be ashamed of my body or anything else about myself. I have huge hips and I?m going to embrace them, I?ve got a big butt and I?m gonna embrace that too. So SCREW YOU! Never let anyone make you feel like you should be ashamed of your body type or any of your insecurities, just be you and like the people who don?t except you can continue to be the stupid haters they are . All to say everyone is beautiful and nobody should ever feel the need to change themselves to please other people or should never call themselves any less than beautiful. I hope sharing this has made other people come to the realization that everyone is beautiful skin deep and if you have Shakira hips or hips of a brandy model being a good person on the inside is what counts the most.
