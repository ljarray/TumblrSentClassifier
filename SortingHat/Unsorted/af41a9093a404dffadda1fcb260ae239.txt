
Ugh� I am just SO tired of hearing about weightloss and how many pounds someone loses and tummy photos�. Like, I need more fitblrs that are focused on fitness, clean eating, positivity, motivation, inspiration, exercise, being healthy�. Not flat stomachs and weight shed�..

I need more blogs focusing on HEALTHY not weight. :/

I need more of this and more zen/meditation blogs. More vegan and vegetarian blogs that aren�t shamey and harsh when trying to teach people�.
