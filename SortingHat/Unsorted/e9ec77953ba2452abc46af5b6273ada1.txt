
Weight Loss Journey
I thought that having a journal would be helpful in documenting my weight loss journey.  So far my main goals are to eat a �Low Carb High Fat� diet and to kick my sugar addiction.  When I was in China about 3 years ago I was 90 kilos.  I didn�t exactly lose that much in 3 years, but I have only been serious about losing weight maybe about two months ago.  This month I have been steadily trying to change my life.  I have to battle Bipolar Disorder with long cycles of depression.  Currently I am seeing a therapist and am on medication.  The medication and my current lifestyle is helping me see that I can do better with my life.  

No more self destruction.  No more depressing posts.  No more negativity.  No more being messy.  No more being low maintenance.  No more being the fat friend.  These are my goals.

I hope to reach my goal in one year ideally.  So without further ado, this is officially Day 1.
