
I just have one small issue with this ?positive body image? movement. I?m all for people feeling good about themselves, not judging based on looks and feeling beautiful without having a model?s figure. That being said, I feel one thing should be said - encouraging obesity is not okay. That is a HEALTH RISK. That doesn?t mean you have to tell these people that they are ugly, it means you have to encourage them to be healthy. Moreover, I have an issue with everyone beautifying smoking. Maybe it?s just me, but I feel that that too is wrong. You are encouraging people to smoke and to harm their bodies - again, this is another health issue. I have no issue with anyone smoking, if that?s what you want to do then do it, but do not encourage others to do so as well. We are encouraging unhealthy habits by masking it as being against judgement. I?m all for this ?no judgement? but I draw a line at encouraging unhealthy habits.
