
Purples, Blues and You
One of the great things about getting older and wiser is realizing what, fashion-wise, works for you?and what never will.

I spent all of my teens and most of my 20s trying on things, buying things and cursing my neck, my thighs, my waist, my calves for not being the right size and shape. I vowed to eat less, do more push ups, wear a jacket, get a tan. 

Look?I will probably never look good in high collars, flesh-tones, ankle boots, strapless dresses. But I can rock plaid, Doc Martens, off the shoulder sweaters and YELLOW like nobody?s business. I?ve got great collarbones, stormy eyes, soft skin, warrior princess legs and I can blog you into whatever emotion I see fit.


When I go shopping now I don?t paw at bodycon dresses, wishing my midsection looked less I swallowed a partially damaged Amazon Prime box?ain?t nobody got time for that. I look for lower necklines. Black, grey, blues, purples, polka dots, houndstooth. Pieces that allow me to sit pretzel-legged, to be confident in grand gestures, to walk faster than average.

I?ve seen myself in pictures, in mirrors, on camera, on the Internet?the research has been done. Mistakes have been made. I know what a great me looks like?de-stressed, well-rested, hydrated, informed?and I?m wise enough to know the steps it takes to get there. I know my cuts, my colors?and that?s not to say I?ll never try anything else?but it IS to say that when I do try those not-me things and they are, definitively, not me? I won?t be destroyed. I won?t assemble an internal siege. I will not regress to junior-high me, plaintively picking at a plain bagel an hour and a half before a six-mile run.


I know more now.

And so do you.
So stop pretending.
