
Current body goals:
Do yoga regularly (get more flexible!)
Workout regularly at home (get stronger, more energy, I?m going to be using backonpointe ?s exercises)
Drink at least 46 Oz of water a day, try to work up to 60 oz.
Floss more regularly
Meditate
Start doing pranayama
Get my skin to clear up somehow? (Maybe going back on BC will do it, or the water increase)
Make that appointment and get back on BC!
See someone about my sciatica (more appointments to make?)

Ugh I probably won?t achieve most of those?

Ever feel like owning a body and keeping it healthy is just too much responsibility?
