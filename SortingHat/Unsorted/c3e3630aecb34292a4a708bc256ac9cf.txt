So to start off the day I had some coffee (1 tsp instant) with 1 tsp of coconut sugar and some vanilla extract (from Mexico!).

For breakfast I had some oatmeal (� cup rolled oats, with 1 cup unsweetened almond milk, some cinnamon and vanilla) with vanilla greek yogurt and � cup of fresh blueberries.

For a snack I had a homemade banana ice pop (using banana, unsweetened almond milk, peanut butter and vanilla greek yogurt). 

For lunch I had a food platter with some cucumber, a peach, a green apple, some broccoli, and a boiled egg, which I added some hot sauce and smoked paprika to.

For another snack I had a carob almond protein bar.

For dinner I had some chicken noodle soup (200mL) and a small spelt tortilla.
