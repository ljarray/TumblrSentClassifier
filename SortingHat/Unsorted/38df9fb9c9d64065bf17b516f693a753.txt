
Posting Thinspo is WRONG #2
You are objectifying the person in the photo by using them as thinspo.

You are boiling them down to nothing but body parts that you are jealous of, when in reality they are a person just like you. They have thoughts, feelings, family, friends, favorite colors, and more. They are people. They are so much more than just a thigh gap.

Assuming they are even still alive, many of them do not want you to use them this way. Many of them would feel violated and humiliated by what you are doing. But you never thought about their feelings, did you?

You treat them like an object.

You ignore that they are people and focus only on one or two aspects of their appearance. You take a whole person, and manage to strip them down until they are nothing but one photo.

That is dehumanizing. Thinspo is dehumanizing.
