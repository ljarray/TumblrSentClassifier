
Alrighty first post and I need people to follow, like this / follow and I will follow back! 

It�s been forever since I�ve had a tumblr strictly about my diet and exercise journey so I�m kind of nervous, but I also know it will hold me more accountable. I�m currently on Advocare (and I am a distributor, but I�m not trying to like hard sell, I just needed the discount yo) I love the products though. You don�t just drop a bunch of pounds, you actually preserve and build muscle. This can be a little discouraging though, because muscle weighs more than fat (not so happy weigh in days??). 

I�m at my highest weight yet, but surprisingly carrying it pretty well (I probably just jinxed myself!) regardless, I need some of it gone! I was literally born chubby and spent my first 15 years being overweight and the �fat friend�, then I sunk into a depression over it and between 16 and 17 I eventually got down to 130 pounds from 185. Not necessarily the right way, but I lost it. I know I can do this again and even better this time! It�s just proving to be a lot harder this go around.

I plan on posting my meal plans/grocery list ideas/workouts/recipes - basically anything to keep me accountable. I want people to be able to talk to about it though! I need lots of fitness blogs to follow (I�ll be following on my main account usedtobeg0ld), help me out guys! 

Hoping to talk to some of y�all soon ~
