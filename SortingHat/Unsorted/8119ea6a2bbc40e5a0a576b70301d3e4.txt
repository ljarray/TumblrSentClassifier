
ever since i cut my hair i?ve been dealing with lots of bad body image issues. maybe it?s because i don?t have 12 inches of hair to hide behind as a safety blanket anymore. i just feel vulnerable and subject to bad thoughts. my bad eating habits don?t help, either. it?s so hard but i?d really love to get back on track and be happy again, like i was a couple of years ago when i was truly happy with myself.
