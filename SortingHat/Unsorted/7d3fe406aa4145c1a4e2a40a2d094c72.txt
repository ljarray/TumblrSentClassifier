
I?ve started to diet like I?ve cut out soda, sweets and I?m thinking of doing a semi vegan thing to see how well I do and who knows after that but

I don?t know at what age I started thinking that no one will love me if I don?t lose weight but it certainly hasn?t faded over the years :/

I need to love myself more
