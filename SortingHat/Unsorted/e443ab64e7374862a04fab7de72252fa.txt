
REBLOG if you think your weight shouldn't matter when dress shopping
My mom and older sister have been giving my younger sister so much shit about losing weight for her Qui?ce and have told her multiple times that if she doesn?t lose weight by a certain date, then they won?t take her dress shopping for her Qui?ce. This has gotten to the point where our mom has told her that she won?t even buy her new clothes for the new school year until she loses weight, because buying her new clothes now will only encourage her to gain weight(Our mom?s words).

I know it?s not much, but every time my sister finishes exercising, or even finishes talking to our mom about her body, she get very upset and I just hope seeing people reblog this and agreeing that weight shouldn?t matter when dress shopping (or even shopping for clothes in general) will make her feel better about the body she has.

This is the first time in all my life that I feel confident enough to accept even taking these photos with my friend, who is a photographer. My body will never be like many people want it to be, but I learned that I am fabulous just the way I am! I keep hearing "You should start a diet, you need to loose weight! And why don't you start treating your stretch marks?" and that makes me wonder: are they seeing me like I see myself in the mirror? Or is it something wrong with my vision? Because I don't feel ugly at all, and I can't see anything wrong with my body! I hope someday all these people that keep telling me about how I should be, can see the world and themselves like I see myself: without all these standarts, and with lots of love! <3
