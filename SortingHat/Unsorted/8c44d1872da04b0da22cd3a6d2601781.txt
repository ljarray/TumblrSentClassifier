
Something very exciting is coming up!
So for a school project, you work for almost 6 months on it, you could do it whatever you want, as long as you?ve done enough research (80 hours) and have like 40 pages work. Mine?s about women their beauty ideals (body, makeup, hair, society?s influence, etc.)
I?m going to do street interviews, internet and book research and probably some photos with examples. So if anyone has some good ideas, or want to tell me something about the subject PLEASE feel free to tell me!
