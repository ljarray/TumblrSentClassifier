
Have to go to bed early but I don?t want to.

Have to fill out job applications but, uuuugh.

Not even all that crazy about photo editing, my pics of Colorado aren?t as good as I wish they where and it pisses me off.  Expensive camera, how dare you betray me like this?!  

Body image issues cropping up?more uuugh.

Also, this year has been full of horrid things.
