
Friday Five
This week was my first full week back (I haven?t had to work Fridays this summer) and it was too long. Someone want to help me petition for three-day weekends year round? 
I saw Ant Man yesterday, complete with a tiny Ant Man sized menu at Alamo. This is why I choose you, Alamo. It wasn?t my favorite Marvel, but it was totally enjoyable. The TWO end credit scenes make it even better. 
Oh hey, if you?ve been following me since last year, you might remember that I got rear-ended nearly a year ago (50 weeks ago to be exact). GUESS WHAT, GUYS? I got rear-ended in the exact. same. intersection. I was in the same stupid turn lane. Apparently, I need to find a new way to drive to the gym. Also, this wreck wasn?t NEARLY as bad as last year (i.e. my trunk still closed and didn?t feel the need to go to the doctor). This guy has insurance and the last guy didn?t so?silver lining? This makes the third summer in a row my car has been hit. Can we not, Universe?
I?m having weird body feels. Like I?m loving the balance I?ve found and how at ease I feel mentally with my relationship with food, but I?d also really like to get rid of about 20+ish pounds of fat. There?s a lot more muscle happening now, but I need to lean out. So what to do?what to do? I?ve even considered reaching out to get a personalized meal plan?Hmm?if anyone has thoughts on this, PLEASE let me know what you think. 
The beginning of the school year is around the corner and I?m out of town next weekend for less than 48 hours for my cousin?s wedding. Needless to point out, things are getting a bit busy around here.
