
I hate that I constantly compare myself to other people, both intellectually and physically. I?ve always been self-aware about it, but I still can?t break the habit.
I hate that I get irrationally angry and bitter about what other people have or what they look like, and I know I shouldn?t. I hate that I just can?t be happy with myself. I hate that I get angry at my own body on a daily basis for not looking how I want it to look despite my hard work. I hate that I doubt myself and my supposed abilities on a daily basis.

The body positivity movement is great, but I won?t ever honestly be okay with how I look or ?love myself? as the movement encourages. That type of confidence and self-love is commendable, but I just don?t ever see myself having it.
