Directions

Toast the bread in a preheated oven until golden and crunchy. In the meantime make the Yogurt and Tahina Sauce. Place the tahina, salt, black pepper, the crushed clove of garlic, and lemon juice in a large bowl and mix to form a paste. Thin the paste with the yogurt until you get a creamy ribbon consistency sauce. Add the chopped parsley and mix well. Set aside.
Meanwhile, peel the eggplant, leaving a few strips of skin on. Make a slit along one of the sides of each eggplant and fry or grill the eggplants until slightly golden brown. Drain the fried eggplants on kitchen towels, and set aside to slightly cool.
Make the Meat filling, by softening the chopped onions in 1 tbsp olive oil, once slightly softened, add the minced garlic and cook until translucent but not browned. Add the minced meat and season with salt and black pepper. Cook stirring occasionally until the juices run out and the meat is slightly browned. Remove from heat, and add the toasted pine nuts. Stir to mix and set aside to cool slightly.
Fill the eggplants - through the side slits - with the meat mixture and set aside.
In a medium cooking pot, heat the remaining tbsp of olive oil and stir fry the chopped, peeled tomatoes and sugar. Mix well and stir fry until the tomatoes have softened and reduced slightly. Add the tomato paste and stir to incorporate. 
Adjust the liquid level if necessary by adding a little water or chicken/beef broth. However you want to end up with a thick sauce not a tomato soup, so be careful about adding too much water. Add the filled eggplants and carefully fold to coat. 
Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.Place the toasted bread in a large saucepan. Re-hydrate them with the broth and toss to coat. Add 1 cup of the yogurt Tahina sauce onto the re-hydrated bread and toss to coat. 
Place the bread mixture at the bottom of a serving dish, top the mixture with the rest of the Tahina yogurt sauce and spread to cover the whole surface. Carefully fish out the stuffed eggplant pieces, and place them on top of the sauce layer. 
Once you have placed all the eggplants, drizzle the sauce all over the tops. Sprinkle the top with finely chopped fresh parsley, and toasted almonds and pine nuts. Serve warm.
