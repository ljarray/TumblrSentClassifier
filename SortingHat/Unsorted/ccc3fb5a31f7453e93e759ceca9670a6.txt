
What I Eat in a Day - July 18
So for breakfast, I had a fruit platter, with a kiwi, green apple, and � cup of frozen mixed berries. I also had a boiled egg and a vanilla greek yogurt that I had frozen the night before!

For a snack I had a homemade ice pop made out of unsweetened almond milk, semi-sweet chocolate and almonds. I also had a string cheese and a cup of blueberries (fresh!).

For lunch I had a slice of whole grain toast with 1 tbsp of peanut butter and some cut up banana on it.

For a snack I had 1/3 cup of raw cashews.

For dinner I had corn on the cob, and some quinoa (� cup uncooked). I added a little bit of salt and smoked paprika to my quinoa.

For a snack before bed, I had a green apple and some goat cheese.
