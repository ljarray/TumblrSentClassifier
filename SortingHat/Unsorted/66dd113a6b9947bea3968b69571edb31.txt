
Suggestion: Chibi Pandantern Commission/Adoptable?
I would like to ask you if you guys could be interested into Chibi pandanterns commissions/Adoptables? :3

I thought, it could be a nice idea and faster way to get your own pandantern, instead of waiting  a long time for a full pic! X3

I�m doing this because I saw a lot of people are interested into pandanterns, and It really makes me happy! :3
Because I saw a lot of people having pandanterns and that�s might interest you as well! 

Here�s the Templates I will use for the Chibis for Males and Females:


                          Chibi Panda Templates FEMALE and MALE

Here�s a Silly Example:




                                Chibi Panda Spring Wo Nushi

You can ask me mostly anything! As long it�s respecting the usual rules (No Futa, morbidly obese stuff and such like those)

All Picture will be done in FULL REZ! so the owners will have the honor, to get the full rez pic and be able to repost it! (Of course Credits will be requierd!)

This way you can have a lore friendly pandantern, with a background you choice! So you could have fun with with them! So you
can ask me to do them normally if you want later! x3

For those who already have a Pandantern, they will be able to get theirs as chibi! and maybe pay less! Since they were already Designed by me! >w>

Most of them Will be done in stream live for you either it�s as a commission or in adoptables (you�ll be able to suggest things for the adoptables).
What�s better than seeing your Panda done in live? Of course I can do it offline! both options are available! >:3

They would be of a fair Price of 10$ dollars Each of them! I know it�s quite a lot of for some people, but I need money, and life isn�t always as bright as it is!

I would like you opinion on it and If you guys would like to like to get one or not! 

thanks you so much for your support on my pandas and such! It really gives me the will to work on those! :3
