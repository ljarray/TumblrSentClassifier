
Why do I always see really strong girls on fitspo blogs doing like one handed pushups and 70 pound weights and shit.

Like I wanna see girls just like me who are happy they completed their set, or are sweating their skin off struggling through the last rep, or trying hard to ignore that jar of Nutella.

I can?t relate to super humans.
