
I?M SO ANGRY THAT GIRLS BELIEVE THEY ARE UGLY BECAUSE HIGH SCHOOL FUCK BOYS DON?T ASK THEM OUT. 
I?M SO ANGRY THAT GIRLS CHANGE THEMSELVES FOR BOYFRIENDS THEY HAVE WHEN THEY ARE 14 AND END UP BELIEVING THEY HAVE TO ACT THAT WAY IN ALL RELATIONSHIPS. 
I?M SO ANGRY THAT GIRLS AREN?T TOLD AT THIS STAGE THAT IT?S THE SHALLOW BOYS WITH THE PROBLEM AND THEY ARE WORTHY OF LOVE AND THEY DON?T HAVE TO CHANGE
