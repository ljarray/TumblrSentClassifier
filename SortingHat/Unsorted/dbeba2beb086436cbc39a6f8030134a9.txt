
Ugh, I?m fine with my body in soooo many ways (especially compared to where I used to be).

But sometimes I really, really, really want to be a lot smaller. And 90% of those times are when I?m knitting and sewing. Patterns would be so much easier to fit if I had fewer curves, and I could save so much money on materials if I were a couple of sizes smaller. And I could knit sweaters up sooo much faster if they were a size M instead of XL.

#on the one hand that seems like the stupidest reason ever to want to lose weight#on the other hand it is probably the smartest and least destructive in so many ways#body image#weight loss cw
