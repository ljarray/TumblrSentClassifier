
I felt disgusting today. To the point that I wore a big shirt to the beach that covered everything from my thighs to neck. In the water and everything. I have no idea what I am going to do if I feel like this after swim season starts.

I just? I?m so afraid? I feel horrible about myself. I look in the mirror and I don?t even recognize myself.
