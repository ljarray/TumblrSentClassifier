
do you ever cry just thinking about how poorly you?ve treated your body? well over half of my life i?ve hated my body. i?ve starved it, got mad at it because my legs wouldn?t fit into a pair of jeans, hated that i didn?t ?look good? in a bathing suit. you give so much power to the negative thoughts in your head. you let them consume you until there?s nothing left but hatred for your body. sometimes it?s hard to remember your body allows you to do SO much. it works hard to keep you alive! breathing, thinking, walking, talking. and you?re punishing it because it?s a lil bloated today? it has taken so much crap from you throughout the years, please be nice to it.
