This is gonna be my �Year in Review� and also my Fat Attack post. These are my absolute favorite photographs of me, ever. They make me feel more gorgeous than I ever have. August 1st has come and (in my area) gone. This past year has really been a journey of self exploration. I have never loved myself as much as I do now. I am full of empathy for the sad girl I used to be, but I am truly optimistic about my future. I love myself. No one can take that from me.

I�ve been fat the majority of my life, although I was a pretty skinny little kid. I got my tonsils taken out when I was 10 and I missed a lot of school because of it, only ate ice cream and gained a bit of weight. It escalated when I went back to school and started being bullied.

They homeschooled me off and on throughout my middle school years. Which in hindsight only led to more depression due to the isolation from peers and lack of exercise. I hated being homeschooled and honestly wouldn�t suggest it to anyone who is remotely social.

My mom and grandma both have some serious issues with the way they look, and instilled that into me. The lack of discipline and the way my family was with me definitely contributed to my issues with food. I tried countless diets and my family wasted a lot of their hard earned money on weight watchers and other similar paid programs. I was 12 when they started that. Rather than just teaching me impulse control, they decided to only get �healthy foods�, so whenever I saw something unhealthy (aka 'delicious� in my mind), I binged. And then I would purge. I would starved myself for days and then binge, and puke. Cut myself because of how much I hated me.

When I began high school I started realizing I was a sexual being. I lost my virginity to a boy a year older than me, when I was fourteen. I found that sex made me feel validated. He was an �edgy� type and in the high school world that just means angsty teen. He was the first person I cared for to ever slap me, or tell me I was worthless.

It began a cycle of shitty relationships and promiscuous behavior with guys and girls that I didn�t even really care about, and sometimes didn�t even know. I took some sort of sick comfort in the fact that I could literally have anyone I wanted. The problem was that the people I wanted were fucking shit.

That lasted until my hasty marriage to an abusive Navy boy a year younger than I. He had a serious fetish for fat chicks and I suspect that�s why he married me. I was married to him for a year and technically am still married to today, even though we�re going through a separation. He was the last straw.

As soon as I realized that self hate and hate of other women gets you literally no where, my life got infinitely easier. I stopped pretending to hate pop music. I stopped pretending in general.

I love myself, god damn it. No man, woman, beast or illness can convince me that I am not amazing and beautiful. You�re welcome to try, but sweetie I won�t go down without a fight.
