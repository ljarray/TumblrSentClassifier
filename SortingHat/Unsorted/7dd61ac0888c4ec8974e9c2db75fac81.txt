
I swear my stomach is some sort of bottomless hole today. I had my yogurt this morning as planned (vanilla dannon oikos, topped with chia seeds, slivered almonds, and blueberries) but it was definitely not enough. So I had a couple of slices of cucumber and I�m gonna have a slice of toast w/ peanut butter and banana. I just can�t let myself go to work hungry because I�m working at Wendy�s for the summer, and if I get hungry I�ll end up buying shitty fast food. I�m probably going to get a half salad at my break as a lunch, but if I�m really hungry I know I�ll be tempted to eat something worse. 

Ugh. Here goes an eight hour shift, then I�m coming home to some delicious salmon and quinoa from last night. Clean eating is hard, man.
