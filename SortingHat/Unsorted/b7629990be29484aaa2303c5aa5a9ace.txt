
if you think for a second that the cool for the summer video is demi ?being a slut? let me tell you a quick story. demi has struggled for YEARS with her body image. she used to do anything in order to have ?society?s perfect body? and eventually that destroyed her. she got help and started to recover and learn to love herself. but still she stuggled with her body, constantly wearing clothes that covered her up. about a year ago she finally started to show her arms more and more which was a HUGE step for her. and just a couple months ago she started wearing shorts and showing her legs, something she hasn?t done in YEARS. cool for the summer is the beginning of demi finally feeling CONFIDENT with herself and with her body. she is healthy and happy and here to show the world that she made it.
