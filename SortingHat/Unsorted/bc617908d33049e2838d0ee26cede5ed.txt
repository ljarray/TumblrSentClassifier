
20 Things Someone With An Eating Disorder Wishes They Could Tell You

I envy you for being able to eat without a burdening feeling of guilt, shame and self loathing.
I often envision myself eating normally - enjoying it - but the idea is always better than reality.
Please don�t feel guilty about eating in front of me. Watching other people eat with enjoyment spread across their faces fills me with a warmth you wouldn�t know.
I wish I could cook for you and share the meal together. I really do.
My anorexia isn�t an attempt to be thin and beautiful. It�s about disappearing entirely.
My bulimia isn�t about having my cake and eating it. It�s about punishing myself.
I�m sorry that I cancel on you so much but my bulimia forces unexpected dates upon me that I have to attend.
If I do ever eat anything in front of you, take that as a huge sign of trust.
If I do ever eat anything in front of you, please don�t bring any attention to this situation.
Eating disorders aren�t just a starvation of food - they are a starvation of life and joy.
I am not being rude when I don�t join in your conversations about food. I just feel so disconnected from that part of life.
It annoys me when you go on diets because you�re perfect and happy as you are. Don�t ruin that. I know where obsession leads.
I didn�t look at a picture of a model and seek to acquire their figure. I looked at myself and hated the reflection; I thought I took up too much space.
When I ask you if I look big, I am not attention seeking. I need reassurance that my quest to diminish is working.
Me not wanting to be your size doesn�t mean I think you�re fat. It means I associate your size with happiness of which I am not worthy of.
When meeting new people, please don�t imply that I eat to try and make me not stand out. I think they will see me as weak for being an eater.
My eating disorder doesn�t act alone; its friends are depression and anxiety.
I used to love food and still do. I probably think about food more than you do.
My eating disorder isn�t a choice - it�s an illness.
I will never expect you to understand me and my disorder as I don�t think I even understand myself.
