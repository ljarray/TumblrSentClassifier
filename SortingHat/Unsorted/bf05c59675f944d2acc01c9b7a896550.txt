
Clean Eating, low carb: Day 1
Breakfast: None, slept in and had to rush to work. (Coffee, sugar twin)

lunch: Turkey salad, hot sauce. Water.

Dinner: 3 egg whites,salsa and an apple. Black tea

Notes: waitressed for 9 hours with no break so I had no energy to work out. Right now I�m focusing on my eating habits and getting used to that before I get into my daily workout routine. I�m trying to eat clean for the next 30 days to see how my body feels/changes.
