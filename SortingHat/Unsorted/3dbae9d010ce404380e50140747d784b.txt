There are four books that should be on your shelf at all time: Eats, Shoots, and Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation by Lynne Truss, On Writing by Stephen King, The Elements of Style by William Strunk, and The Writer�s Market. These books are concise, easy to read, and worth their weight in gold.

1. Eats, Shoots, and Leaves goes over basic punctuation and grammar in a comical manner. The joke is that a Panda goes into a bar, orders food and a beverage. After he finishes his meal he fires off rounds into the ceiling and exits. The bartender chases after him and asks him why he would do that. The panda pulls out a badly written brochure and points to a piece that says, �Panda: Eats, Shoots, and Leaves.� I�m paraphrasing, of course, on how I remember it, but it�s a good example of what makes this book so entertaining. AmazonPrime is selling this book for $9.74 and iBooks has it listed for

2. On Writing is a book that took me by surprise. It is the only non-fiction novel, as far as I know, written by Stephen King and it is so good. Before I read it I was one of those people that would begin a novel and be pounding away at it for hours, but then a day would come where it would sit untouched and that day would gradually turn into weeks. By the time I finally picked my manuscript back up, I�d find myself having to get back into a groove, which I usually didn�t do. This book gave me the motivation to finish my first novel. It also sent me in the right direction towards my next adventure in the publishing industry. I have mad respect for Stephen King as a writer. Even if you�re not an avid fan of his works purchase this book. You�ll be amazed what it can do for you. This book is listed for $9.93 on AmazonPrime.

3. The Elements of Style is not as fun as the first two. It is technical and concise. The table of contents includes: �Elementary Rules of Usage,� �Elementary Principles of Composition,� �A Few Matters of Form,� �Words and Expressions Commonly Misused,� and �Words Often Misspelled.�  You can easily read the book in one day. This book is free on iBooks. There is no reason for you to leave this book from your collection.

4. The Writer�s Market is not a necessity for somebody just getting back into writing, but it is something you want. It has lists of publishers, articles on how to blog, articles on how to write letters of inquiry, articles on just about anything you can think of� I picked it up mainly to start getting a feel for the world of publishing. I haven�t had any kind of mentor to guide me with their council when it comes to these things and they are all so exotic to me still. This book will help you understand what you need to know about the world of marketing your work. Expect to pay $20.12, depending on where you purchase it.  

These four books are just the beginning of a journey. If you have any recommendations for me and other people please comment them below and share with us a bit about them. I would love to know what you think about these books after you�ve read them.
