
I used to hate having stretch marks from being pregnant. Sometimes I still feel uncomfortable in a swimsuit, I won?t lie. But I?ve come to appreciate my body and the woman I?ve become because my son has made me a better person and has taught me to love myself and my imperfections regardless. I have a wonderful fianc? who loves me for who I am. He still thinks I?m beautiful. Sometimes, as people, we are our worst critics and you know what? We need to stop and just appreciate the life we have and not be bothered by the little things that we see as flaws. Our flaws are what makes us who we are. So love yourself.
