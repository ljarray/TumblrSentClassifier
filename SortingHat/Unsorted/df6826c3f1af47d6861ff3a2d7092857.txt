
Don?t Judge Challenge
The ?Don?t Judge Challenge? is one of the most disgusting things I?ve seen in a long time. Here we have people mocking things that aren?t considered attractive, such as unibrows, acne and glasses. The fact that the challenge is named after a saying that means we shouldn?t judge somebody by their appearance makes this even worse.

This challenge is nothing more than a way of bullying people who have these ?imperfections?. Your worth is not determined by your physical appearance. As cliche as it sounds, it?s who you are on the inside that counts.
