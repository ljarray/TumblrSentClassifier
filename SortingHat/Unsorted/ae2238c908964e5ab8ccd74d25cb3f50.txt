
exception of change
I love how it says body ?
One thing I find hard to accept is the change of my body - other things I now don?t find as hard to. I?ve been away two weeks and granted not a lot will have have changed that I?ve noticed but it?s there. At one stage in my life I would let it get to me and I would try to adjust but it?s not a change in me so why should I?
Granted I?ve put holiday weight on,a problem that roots deep inside me which I find hard to grasp. But THAT is a change for me which again I will not adjust to BUT CHANGE - for my self worth and happiness.
Someone told me - do it for you and no one else. 
I will!!
