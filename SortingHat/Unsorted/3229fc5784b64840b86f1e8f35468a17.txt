
So it's finally the school holidays
I work in a school so I always look forward to the holidays to really focus! Which, so far, I have! I will post a pic of today�s meal later when I actually finish eating all of them!

A quick run through of yesterday:

Breakfast - two small pieces of wholemeal toast with a thin spread of (proper) butter and a watermelon/mint/chia/protein powder smoothie ??

Snack 1: about 10 mixed olives

Lunch: fish with rice and mixed veg

Snack 2: two �Graze� punnets

Dinner: wholewheat noodle stir-fry with broccoli, babycorn, mange tout, spinach, cashews and steak.

I drank lots of herbal tea and water too.

Exercise: 30 mins of walking/jogging/running on an incline. 
I really suck at running (like REALLY) and very rarely do it, but even school holiday I like to go to my boyfriends in the day when no-one is home (I�m not a fan of exercising with an audience) and try to get better. I think I�m trying to go to fast which is why I�m getting so tired so quickly so today I worked on stamina rather than pace and just jogged very slowly. Update on today later on tonight.
