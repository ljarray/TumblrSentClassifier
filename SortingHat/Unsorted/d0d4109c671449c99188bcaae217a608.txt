
What I Eat in a Day - July 15
For breakfast I made a smoothie, using � an avocado, 1 banana, � cup unsweetened almond milk, 1 kiwi, 1 cup of spinach and some cucumber. I ate that with 1 tbsp of chia seeds!

For a snack I ate an apple.

For lunch (although it was more like a second snack, tbh) I had vanilla greek yogurt with � cup of shaved almonds.

Later, for a snack, I had a Nature Valley sweet & salty peanut granola bar, and then a green apple and some string cheese.

For dinner I had a wrap, using a whole wheat tortilla, some leftover chicken and a red pepper.

�And for a snack, I had an Asian pear and 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk (boiled), with cinnamon, of course!

So that�s what I ate on Wednesday!
