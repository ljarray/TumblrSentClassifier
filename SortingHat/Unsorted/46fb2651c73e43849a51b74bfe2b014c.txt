
never getting positive attention from guys (if someone was being friendly it was a joke - ?flirt with the ugly girl it?ll be funny?) means that I rly don?t trust when guys give me positive attention now

honestly a lot of the time it?s probably still pity or a joke, no one actually finds me attractive, but even if it was genuine I wouldn?t believe it. I?m still the ugly girl
