
I've been thinkin...
So I?ve always thought 1 of 2 things due to some things that have happened in my life: 1- that I didn?t want to be in a relationship because I didn?t think I could grow as a person if I was with someone and the ole ?well how can I be with someone when I don?t know myself? crap. Or I watch my mom and step dad have a terrible marriage and I want to avoid that at all costs. I also don?t want to feel abandoned in my relationship because in every kind of relationship I can have I have been abandoned in some way. more than that I don?t want to be stuck and miserable. then there is 2- I don?t want to be hurt by someone or hurt someone but I also don?t want to be alone. I mean I am such a homebody so I have no problem being by myself but in terms of having someone love me and want to be with me is important to me. I want to be happy. I want to share my life with someone.

However, even though I have had this internal battle of the pros and cons about being in a relationship and actually tryin to meet someone, I?ve realized that I have been sayin that I want to be loved and love someone back but more importantly I don?t just want someone, I want someone to WANT and DESIRE me as much as I them.

I keep thinkin that until I lose my weight that no one is gonna want to be with me. I hate that feelin. But then I think well once I get skinny it won?t be so difficult but then I wonder, well if someone doesn?t want me while I?m like this why should I like them when I get skinny?? I don?t know I just don?t know what battles I need to fight with this one and which ones I should just say let it go and just be happy? I don?t know? relationships are complicated.
