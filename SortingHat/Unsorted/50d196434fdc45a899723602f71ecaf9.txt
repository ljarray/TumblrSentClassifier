
the deceit of mirrors
the mirror is a useless thing?
clear glass smudged by the viewer?s eyes

it cracks beneath our fingers,
it only supports our lies

and the truth is the truth is marred the moment we touch it,
so the mirror is a useless thing

we depend upon a precise reflection we cannot perceive
