
Personal
I weighed 109.0 lbs today and I am such a complete failure. I feel fat and disgusting, even though I know I�m *technically* neither of those things.
I was at a pretty and petite 103 lbs at the start of this summer. I�ve just lost control; My eating habits have become horrid and I binge nearly every night, even though I tell myself I�m not going to. 
My thighs have grown back together so that they touch at the top and my stomach bows outward. 
But I feel like I can�t stop. It�s gotten to the point where I�m terrified to eat a single thing, because I know I�ll lose control after that. I just want to spit out everything that passes my lips, before it is too late.
