Top NINE Tips For Losing Fat And Toning Up

Losing fat and toning is fairly straight forward. There are many myths and lies being peddled to you from many sources in this day and age. These tips will help you succeed rather than fail as they have worked all around the world with trainers and trainees that value results. Donï¿½t let the snake oil salesman sabotage your weight loss goals and rip you off. You can eat great food that nourishes your body rather than poisons it, you owe it to yourself and your family. Exercise of the right kinds will also maximise your results. Slow endless cardio will slow your BMR not increase it, and resistance exercise will build lean muscle which burns excess calories and you will also look amazing:

1.) Eat about 170 g of protein at each meal.

2.) Eat a variety of coloured vegetables daily.

3.) Low GI fruit, seeds, nuts for snacks.

4.) Wholemeal wholegrain pasta, bread etc.

5.) 20 minutes of HIIT cardio ever 2nd day eg interval sprints.

6.) Resistance training for the whole body especially the large muscle groups for about 40 minutes every 2nd day. Resistance bands are really versatile and portable.

7.) Personal or group Personal Training.

8.) Adequate hydration, sleep.

9.) Stretching, foam rolling after each workout.

Protein could include lean meat from chicken breasts, kangaroo steaks, pork midloin with trimmed fat, steak trimmed of fat, tofu, eggs in moderation.

Colourful vegetables contain all different types of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber. Dark green leafy vegetables are especially good for you eg. Spinach.

Apricots are an example of low GI fruits. Also include berries for good health.

Wholemeal breads and other grain sources are very important for fiber and other nutrients.

Interval cardio gets your fat burning furnace cranking for up to 48 hours after a workout.

Resistance training with progressively heavier weights/resistance builds lean muscle mass which burns about 100 calories per kg per day.

Water and sleep help to flush out toxins. Water percentages should be over 50% to 65% for non athletes, and 5 % more for athletes. Preferable level is about 60%. Drink over 2 litres of fluids during cooler months, and over 3 litres in summer.

Stretching muscles after resistance training brings them back to a normal state. Foam rolling and/or tennis ball use of muscle slings and fascia is also important.

Group Personal Training is fun, accountable, motivating, social, and affordable.
