
C- Living with hyper-pigmentation has rendered my self-esteem basically non-existent. I haven?t worn a bathing suit in almost 15 years, a tank top in 17 years. I hate summertime the most. My friends all want to go swimming or to the beach and I can?t go. I am constantly wearing long-sleeves and hoodies. I avoid low-cut shirts and short-shorts. I don?t feel at all attractive and will even keep a shirt on during sex. I took it off once and although I was well-received, I felt disgusting and still regret it. I think about that one time I was entirely naked in front of this person and it makes me want to throw up. I make me want to throw up.

I find myself even in public staring at people who are able to show skin and it makes me anxious, jealous. It makes me question whether or not I will have any value to anyone if I can?t look like that. Why would someone choose me when they can choose someone they can actually stand to look at?

I haven?t told anyone about it. Some of my friends know I have hyper-pigmentation but, no one knows that it actually bothers me or that it makes me question myself constantly. I hate it so much. People don?t mean to be hurtful but, when they mistake my spots for ?track marks? or ask ?what happened to you?? It kills me. Nothing happened to me, I was born this way. I don?t do drugs, I never have.

Sad part is, I am a psychology student, lol. I know this level of self-esteem is not normal and I know my beliefs about myself are dangerously similar to body dysmorphic disorder but, I can?t stop. Whenever I look in the mirror or think about myself, I want to cry and/or vomit. Even writing this now I want to cry. I want to be considered ?pretty? so bad but, any compliment I get, I disregard. My beliefs and behaviors, although founded, are not logical. And yet, I can?t stop. I guess a lifetime of sneers and probing questions really wears on you.
