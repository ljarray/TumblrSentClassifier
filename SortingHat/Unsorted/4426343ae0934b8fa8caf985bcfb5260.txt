
Things of life. Part 1. Health
1. I am sick� again. My body is not dealing with all the crap I have been feeding it. I work so much that I�m too tired to cook so I have take aways which makes me feel like crap and tired because no nutrition so I feel too tired to cook and I introduced myself into a vicious cycle.

It�s actually ridiculous what rubbish I have been feeding myself.

I�ve had stupid headaches that last days and now I have swollen tonsils, they aren�t infected so its not tonsillitis�. yet just swollen. Most likely too much dairy products because tbh my body just doesn�t handle dairy at all. So�

1(a) going dairy free again. My body can handle tiny bits but I�ve been buying cows milk again and eating butter and I�m going back to my oil spreads and almond milks and fixing my tonsils (I should know better by now!

1(b) We�ve had junk free June and now dry July. Well welcome to (almost)CRAP free life. Time for clean eating, whole foods and looking after my god dawn body again!!!
