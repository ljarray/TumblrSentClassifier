
Dessert tonight was officially the weirdest thing I have ever made. I planned to have a mug cake, but realised I didn�t have any eggs. Instead of just going without, I got creative and came up with a new protein mug cake recipe: protein powder, sugar free maple syrup and SODA WATER. Yep. It�s an amazing raising agent and has very little flavour of its own to taint the food with and it was DELICIOUS. Weird-ass texture but tasted sooo good.

WIN ??
