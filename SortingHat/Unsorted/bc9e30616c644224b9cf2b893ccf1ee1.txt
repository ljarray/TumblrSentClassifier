
Another mental note:

You are on vacation.

It is okay to eat.

It is okay to not be incredibly strict with your calorie consumption.

It is okay to have drinks with your friends.

It is okay to desire dessert after a savory meal.

It is okay to fill your belly up until you are satisfied.

It is okay if you go over that point into the territory of a ?food coma.?

It is okay to not go to bed convincing yourself that you aren?t hungry despite under-eating the entire day.

You won?t lose control.

You won?t give in.

You are stronger than you know.
