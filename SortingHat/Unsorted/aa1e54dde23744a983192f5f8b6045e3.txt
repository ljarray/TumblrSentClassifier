
Strawberry-Banana Soft Serve

Okay what�s better than Friday? Ice cream. And having ice cream on a Friday morning is just the greatest thing next to bagged milk. You might be thinking � that�s not a breakfast food and it�s definitely not healthy. Oh how you are mistaken! 

This delicious ice cream is made out of frozen fruit and just a little bit of almond milk. Top it with fresh fruit, not only is it incredibly yummy but great for your body and conscience too!. 


I suggest if you want to have this for breakfast or I guess late breakfast today, freeze the bananas and strawberries for about an hour and a half. It will be softer than it would had you kept them in the freezer for a whole day, but it still tastes just as good. 

This recipe is really only composed of three ingredients: bananas, strawberries, and almond milk. The peanut butter and dark chocolate are what I topped it with but you can use whatever you want! 


So for my first layer, I put in about � of a frozen banana and maybe 2 tbsp. ( this is a guesstimate, I didn�t actually measure, I just poured) of almond milk. it may not seem like much, but too much almond milk makes it more like a soup or a very runny milkshake. 

Anyway, I used the puree setting on my food processor and I find it blends it wonderfully. At times you will think it is too dry and not blending, I want you to push past this and keep going. You will thank me later. Once it is at the consistency of the above picture, scoop it out into whatever and put it in the freezer. This will keep it in its frozen glory while you make the other two layers. 


For the second layer, use the remaining � of the banana and about � a cup of frozen strawberries and about 3 tbsp. almond milk. The strawberry is very defined in this, I only used the last of the banana to give it a little sweetness. Frozen strawberries on their own tend to be a little tart. Blend away! 


At this stage you will most likely want to kill me. It doesn�t look like it will blend into a creamy ice cream and you�re half right. 

Add max, another tbsp and a half of milk. Then blend and keep scraping down the sides as you go, it will turn into ice cream trust me. Once it is all mixed, add this to the 1st layer and put back into the freezer. 


For the final layer, use 1 full banana and 2 tbsp of almond milk. Blend until creamy and then add to 1st and 2nd layer. Return to freezer. 


This part is where you can add anything you want to top it, but if you have a lack of ideas, I�ll tell you what I added to mine. I added about � a tbsp of melted PB to the top and set it back into the freezer so it wouldn�t get soupy. 

Do you remember that chocolate sauce that you put on ice cream and it would harden into a shell? Well that�s what I wanted to do with the peanut butter. And boy was it good! I left it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and came back to a crunchy and soft dessert. YUMMY! 


Finally, I grated a square of dark chocolate to the top. Voila! You have what tastes like a PB+J sandwich with banana and chocolate, but in the form of ice cream. 

I like to then put the full thing back into the freezer for an extra 5 minutes to firm it up into a semi hard serve- semi soft serve. And in the time you are waiting for it you can clean the dishes you used to make this monster of a breakfast!
