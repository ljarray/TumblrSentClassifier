
Day 26: No Gym like home
So I�m visiting my aunt this week and I wanted to go to the gym.

For those of you who do not know, I belong to planet fitness. I have a white card membership card, which I found out doesn�t let you move to another planet fitness that is out of state for free. So I had to pay a fee of five dollars whatever.

Well the planet fitness by my aunt�s house is MASSIVE. It�s got different rooms for abs and arms and they have all these machines I�ve never used before! And normally I�m pretty excited to try new things, especially when it comes to fitness, but I felt extremely intimated. I didn�t feel comfortable what so ever.

And I even struck up a conversation with a guy who showed me how to properly use one of the machines (after I failed completely and was totally embarrassed that I needed help) I still felt very out of place and uncomfortable.

So I realized that there really isn�t a gym like your regular gym. You know people there, like the hot guy who works the desk, and the girl with the gauges who always smiles at you when you pass her, and the older lady who always wears jeans to the gym. You get use to these people and like where everything is in your gym and it�s weird when you don�t have that.

I miss my gym.
