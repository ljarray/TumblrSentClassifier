
Ok, I think it?s time for me to accept the fact that my skin just doesn?t react well to Nair.

That?s another one to cross off the list.

Nair doesn?t work well, electric razors don?t work well, regular razors don?t work well?

Maybe I just have to accept that having body hair is just a part of my life no matter how gross and dysphoric it makes me feel?

#dysphoria#body image#i really hate my body right now#everything about me is gross
