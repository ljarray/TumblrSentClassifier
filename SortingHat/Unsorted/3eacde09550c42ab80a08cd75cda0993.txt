
Body posi rant kinda
Okay quick rant! 
I am a plus sized girl, so in other words I?m a fat girl (omg she said the ?f? word oh no!!! Yea fuck your fat phobia I?m fat I?m not saying to insult myself I?m simply stating facts get over it!)
Ive always been a bigger girl my whole life. It really bothers me that most ?plus sized? woman on YouTube and in the media AREN?T EVEN FUCKING PLUS SIZED!!! And if they are a bit bigger they all have an hour glass figure! 
There are so many different body types!! 
I?m a 5 foot tall 235 pound girl with shoulders like a football player. I have narrow hips and large thighs! I have large breast ( I wear a 40DD most of the time mostly cause I have such a wide back and shoulders) and I have no ass whatsoever!! Also I am apple shaped meaning most of my weight is in my stomach making me look very round. 
I have never once seen someone with a body shape similar to mines in the media (besides Tess Holiday but even the she is more ?curvy? than round like me) or have a large following on social media like Sarah Rae Vargas and people like that. 
If ya are going to preach body positivity and self love STOP ONLY SHOWING BIGGER GIRLS WITH PEAR AND HOUR GLASS FIGURES!!!
I know for a fact that I am fucking beautiful and so is my body shape.
But younger me didn?t know that. All younger Gisselle saw was that it was okay to be fat only if you have a pear or hourglass figure or its okay to be fat as long as you had large breasts and a large butt and that?s not how it works!! Is it so hard for everyone to stop only praising bigger girls that have a certain body shape and not all bigger girls?!?!
