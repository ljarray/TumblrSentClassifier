
Tips for becoming VEGAN!
As requested by an anon, here are a few of my top tips for becoming vegan! 

1. Do your research 

Ethical 

Learn about the ethical reasoning behind the vegan movement. Make sure you can lay out some simple, plain facts to anyone who might ask about it. People are curious - they will ask WHY you�re vegan! Make sure you can answer some simple questions your friends and family might throw at your. In particular, learn about the dairy and egg industries. People are more likely to be confused about why you don�t consume those products over why you don�t consume meat.

Environmental 

Learn about the environmental impacts of the animal production industries. e.g. Your environmental footprint is far smaller when eating a vegan diet, is more sustainable, causes less environmental/habitat destruction, contributes far less to climate change and global warming, and requires less water.

Health 

Do LOTS of research into the health effects of a vegan diet. This is one thing that people will argue when they run out of arguments for animal cruelty - you will get a LOT of people telling you you�ll be iron deficient, protein deficient, lacking in the �essential vitamins� meat provides blah blah blah. Find out where you�ll get all your nutrients from in a vegan diet, which plant foods are rich in protein, iron, B12, calcium etc. Also learn a bit about the long term negative health effects of an animal based diet vs the positive health benefits of a plant based diet. e.g. Meat eaters are far more likely to develop cancer and heart disease, dairy is linked to osteoporosis and allergies etc.

Also it�s super easy to find out how to make your old favourite meals vegan - you can literally make a vegan version of EVERYTHING! e.g. google �vegan gravy recipe� or 'vegan stroganoff recipe� - google is your friend!

3. Make sure you�re eating properly

Because plant foods tend to be less energy dense than animal products, it can be easy to accidentally under eat when transitioning to a vegan diet. To start with it might not hurt to include some more energy dense foods such as avocado, dried fruit and nuts, just to be sure that you won�t be lacking in energy. As you become more comfortable with this change in diet, you can start experimenting with your macros e.g. 801010, rawtil4, whatever floats your boat. Or just eat whatever and however you like! Just be conscious of getting enough of your essential nutrients so you don�t find yourself lacking in anything further down the track.

Getting a blood test every six months is also something I recommend (for everyone, not just vegans!). Also taking a B12 supplement might be a good idea, as it�s a difficult nutrient to get in any kind of diet these days. I also take a couple of tablespoons of blackstrap molasses each day, just to give myself an iron boost. It�s a nutrient packed powerhouse of a syrup!

4. Be PASSIONATE!

Whatever your reasons are for becoming vegan, whether they be ethical, environmental, health or all three, be PASSIONATE and INTERESTED in them! Do your research, learn as much as you can about each area, understand why you personally have made this choice.

Good luck with your transition to a vegan lifestyle - I hope this helps! And well done for choosing to make such a positive change, not just for yourself, but for the planet, AND the animals.
