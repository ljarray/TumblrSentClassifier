
Having an insurmountable amount of trouble lately. I am so full of hate for myself and my own body that I am genuinely afraid. 
I just finished a 1.5 mile run, came home, and sat on my floor and cried because my effort will never be enough. I will never look as I should. Beauty in unattainable to me and I am a mess.
