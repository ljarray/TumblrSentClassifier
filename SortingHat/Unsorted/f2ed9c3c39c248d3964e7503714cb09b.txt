
Good morning beautifuls!
Hows everybody doing? :)
Just wanted to write in my quick update.  Its currently 6:35am.  I had a plate of banana and blue berries with honey for breakfast! (serving sized of course!) And i had some organic white pomegranate tea with that! Then I did a short 20 minute stretching and ab workout.  An now I�m on here and drinking a bottle of water. (: 

I have OFFICIALLY switched to completely vegan as of this morning.  Do any of you have vegan weight loss success stories?  

PS: if you�re vegan (or interested), get on netflix and check out the documentary Vegucated.  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
