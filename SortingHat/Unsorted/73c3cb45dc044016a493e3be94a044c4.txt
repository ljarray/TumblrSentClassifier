
What I Eat in a Day - July 13
So, for breakfast I had some oatmeal (� cup rolled oats, � cup unsweetened almond milk, � cup water, and some vanilla extract and cinnamon), with some vanilla greek yogurt and 1 cup of frozen mixed berries.

For a quick snack I had 4 slices of cold cut turkey.

For lunch I made homemade spinach �pies�. I used 1 whole wheat tortilla, some spinach and goat cheese, and I just put the spinach and goat cheese in the tortilla and baked it for ten minutes on in side.

For a high-protein snack I had a coconut almond peanut Clif bar, and later, a green tea kiwi ice pop that I made myself.

For dinner I tried to make �noodles� using carrot and apple, with a creamy avocado cheese sauce, but I failed MISERABLY, so I ended up just eating a plate of cucumber, steamed broccoli and a pear.

Then, for a bedtime snack I had some frozen red grapes (approx. 1 cup).

And that�s what I ate! (btw sorry I haven�t updated these in a while).
