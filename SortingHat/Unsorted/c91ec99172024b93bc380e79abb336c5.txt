
SM been hiding all of their talents. LUHAN, KRIS and now TAO. It�s all part of the marketing strategy but they didnt expect all of them to leave. It�s the new generation, you can�t be working with the �old� methods anymore. SM didnt give them a chance, they fought for a chance. When their chance came and became better than what SM thought they were suppose to be, SM panicked. 


SM wake up please. Dont you see their talents? 3 left and it still doesnt matters to you? theres a saying once bitten twice shy. i think no matter how many times you have been bitten you will never be shy. Because a lesson is taught but you�ll never learn.
