It wasn�t until after college when I had my first sit down job that I all of a sudden really knew what �fat� was. Then I lost weight. Then I gained weight. Then I struggled with emotional eating and depression and on January 1, 2012 I weighed in at 242 lbs. I lost 45 lbs by that fall and by the next summer I became pregnant with #2. Last August I weighed in at 240 lbs again. Lost 40+ lbs by December but then gained 15 lbs or so over the course of 2015. But I am learning to love my body as it is now. I can run. I am strong. I am flexible. I look great. I will never be a size 2 or have abs of steel. It�s never ever been a goal of mine. I like how feminine I feel with my curves. And I�m generally healthy. Being �fat� isn�t an automatic death sentence or that I am not �athletic�. Just means there is a bit more of me to love.
