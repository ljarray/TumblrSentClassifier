
What Was Said And Meant
He told me that it wasn�t necessary to eat that�

but he meant that I was pushing it.

He meant that I wasn�t fit,

that I wasn�t lean

and that dating me was a kindness.

And he didn�t find this to be hurtful or damaging.

What he didn�t know is that I would go on managing my weight as if it were prizefighter that needed representation.

He hurled the insult the way I wanted to my food in hopes I�d be beautiful enough for him.

Beautiful enough and thin�

Beautiful enough within didn�t satiate his appetite.

And though I�d had the right to be upset and indignant

I said nothing contingent upon breaking up but,

my heart was already broken up what

else

was

there

to

do.

I allowed this man to tell me absolutely who I was,

none of which suggested that I could be attractive despite my size

I had eyes bigger than my heart and just couldn�t digest what I was being fed.

In my head he said he didn�t want me.

Out loud he was looking out for me. Lovingly restricting me and preventing me from further tipping the scales.

In my head he couldn�t stand me as I was.

Out loud he standing just because he felt his ground more fertile than my own so he told me it wasn�t necessary to eat that�

but he meant that I should go running for the hills.

That I deserved better than the stills of me he had in his head in the shape and form of someone else.
