
A New Start
So here�s the official start of my blogging about my weight loss journey. I�ve been wanting to do one for a while to be honest, as a way to record my journey both highs and lows.  I want to have a detailed account of my journey to healthiness (and eventual happiness) I also hope to inspire other people to get on their own journey to better health.  

I�m 22 years old and I�ve always been �fat� (Not saying that as a negative thing, but it�s true.) My highest weight ever was somewhere between 245 and 250. I was big, lethargic, and basically miserable. Eating and Sleeping were my phases. I was like a bear.  About 2 years ago I started the whole process of losing weight and within a year I lost 50 lbs. I just broke up with a crappy boyfriend and finally decided to get my ass into shape. Unfortunately I relapsed, got a new boyfriend (Much better than the old!) and just�gave up. He made me feel as if I didn�t need to lose weight anymore. I got back into my old habits and regained up to 35 lbs.  About 2 months ago (According to MFP anyway. 6/02/15) I weighed in at 235. I was shocked. I knew I had been gaining weight but I had no idea it was that bad. So since then I�ve decided to take a more permanent approach to weight loss. I am exercising a few times a week and I�m tracking the foods I eat more often, and allowing for 2 cheat days (While still holding myself accountable on those days) and I want to take the slow and steady route, to avoid relapse again.

So as of now my stats:

HW: 235

CW:228

GW:165 (May change later on)

Please like and follow me and I�ll follow back. I find a lot of motivation from other fitblrs and the like and hope I can someday inspire and motivate someone else!!
