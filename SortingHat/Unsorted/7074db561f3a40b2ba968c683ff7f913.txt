I want to get fit, but every time I follow a fitness blog, it?s just white girls with thigh gaps. This isn?t motivating to me at all. They?re impressive, and I am sure they have worked very hard for their bodies, but that?s not my goal. I often see these ?motivational? fitness posts that show two really fit people kissing. It?s like it?s saying, ?As soon as you?re fit, someone will love you!? I actually think this is pretty problematic. I?m getting fit for me. I like my body (most days) and just want to be a healthier person with better habits! I personally will never be a blonde girl with a thigh gap, and I know it?s an unrealistic ideal, so I end up feeling more discouraged than when I started. Has anyone else had this experience?
