
Oh my gosh. I could cry right now. I just took progress pictures and compared them to the ones I took when I started to get serious about this journey in March. I can see results. I can see my progress. Oh my gosh. I am so happy!

This hasn?t been easy. I gained a lot of weight in 2014 as a result of depression, being extremely sedentary, and eating when I was bored. I would actually have anxiety attacks thinking about my weight, body, and overall health. I would go to the gym and have anxiety attacks in the parking lot. I would go into the gym and then start crying in the locker room. I?d give up on working out after 2 days. It/I was a disaster, and I thought I was going to be overweight for the rest of my life because of my mental illnesses.

But now I am SEEING the progress that I?m FEELING! I?m getting stronger every week. My muscles are burning all of this fat. This is really happening, and I am absolutely loving it. It?s changing my body but also my mind. I love going to the gym now, and it actually helps calm my anxious mind. I can?t believe I am finally becoming someone who I want to be ? someone who I?m so proud of and excited for. I no longer cry when I look in the mirror because of the hate and disgust I feel for my body. I know my body is working hard to show the love I?m putting into it, and I get so excited when I flex and can see my baby muscles.

I can?t wait to be able to share my progress pictures here. This is such a life-changing journey for me. I could cry.
