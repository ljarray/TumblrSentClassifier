
You Love You - A Poem by Mackenzie Rowe
There has been a moment,

No matter who you are

When you?ve looked in the mirror

And hated what you saw



Whether you?re a boy or a girl,

Short or tall,

Thin or thick,

It doesn?t matter at all



It may be just or a second,

Or years in the making,

But you look in the mirror

And hate the smile you?re faking



Well, next time that happens

Use this wonderful trick,

That I learned from a girl,

When what I saw in the mirror

Used to make me feel sick



Look in that mirror,

Stare right into your eyes,

And count five things about your body

Whether it?s your hair, lips or thighs

That you love about yourself



It may take a minute,

Or an hour or two,

But don?t look away until,

You Love You
