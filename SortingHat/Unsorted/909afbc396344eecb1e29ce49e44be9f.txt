
Pet peeve af
I literally cannot stand when people are obsessed with weight loss/dieting. When it�s all you talk about or all you have to comment on, it�s such a turn off to me when someone obsesses over this and lectures other people.

All of this isn�t just because I consider myself overweight..but because people really don�t know what their comments actually translate to. Watch out for your own health, keep track of what YOU eat, watch YOUR weight. If you�re happy with your body, that�s awesome.. But someone else�s opinion of what a �good body� looks like it might be completely opposite of yours.
