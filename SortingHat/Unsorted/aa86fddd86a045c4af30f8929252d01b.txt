
I feel like the fitness industry is structured around people never being satisfied. No one is every fully happy. People are either desperately trying to get their dream body?s, or they have achieved their dream body?s and are now trying desperately not to loose them. It?s a constant battle with no satisfaction unless you release control and honor the place your body wants to be.
