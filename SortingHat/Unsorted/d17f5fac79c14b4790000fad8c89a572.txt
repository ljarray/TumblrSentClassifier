
I LOVE ME


How can I love myself when my own mother doesn�t love me?
Screaming hurtful words at me,
You need to lose weight you need to be pretty you need to me smart
I dont even know how to please her and everyone but I�ll try to do that

I am a plus size I know
But I love my body and it�s not just for show
Its the shell that�s made for me
So why the hell would you want to change me?

I�m tired of you criticizing my every move
How would you like it if I�m thin as a tube
Believe it or not I am anorexic
I used to love food but now its just toxic

I am also bulimic for those who asks
I throw up food I eat and that�s my task
You want me to be skinny fine I�ll do that
But don�t complain when I look like a corpse for being addicted to look perfect like that

You made me feel ashamed to be I�m my own skin
Is that the new definition of beauty �thin�?
Not all girls wants abs
Just like some boys love fats

We all have our own definition of beauty
So shut up because I think I�m pretty
I don�t need to change for anyone but myself
Actually I�ll just stay the same and just be myself

Listen to me and listen to me good
How many times should I say I LOVE FOOD
You�re motivating me to kill myself
Because starvation is not the answer for loving yourself

Let me get this through your head okay
I love my body I love it in every way
So why change me when I�m already contented
Is it because you also have failed that commitment?
