5 Natural Weight Loss Supplements

There are hundreds of supplements out there; we know what a minefield can be trying to separate the good from the bad.

To make life easier, we�ve picked out 5 of the best.

1-Garcinia Cambogia:

Top of our list is the Garcinia Cambogia. This has been part of Asian and African food culture for centuries because it helps to add substance to dishes that would otherwise be unsatisfying.

The key lies in its powerful ability to reduce appetite as it is a natural appetite suppressant. In terms of weight loss, it increases the metabolism, encouraging the body to burn more fat.

On top of this, it reduces the level of fat that you absorb from other food. You also get the bonus of a general health boost, such as a more powerful immune system.

2-Green Coffee:

The coffee bean may something you�d find in every household but did you know that in its dry and roasted form, it has lost virtually all of its natural health benefits.

The extract is taken from the raw, untouched green coffee bean. The caffeine it contains has long been known to promote healthy weight loss but, in addition, you get the antioxidant qualities of chlorogenic acid. This stimulates fat reduction and regulates your sugar levels, encouraging a better metabolism.

3-Raspberry Ketone:

As the name suggests, this is found in raspberries but in fact it also occurs in cranberries and blackberries. A �Ketone� is simply a type of organic compound, a natural chemical in the fruit, amongst other things. How does it kick start weight loss? Well, mainly by encouraging the body�s production of adiponectin, a natural protein which speeds up the breakdown of fat. Coupled with regular exercise, this supplement will help shed those pounds.

4-Saffron Extract: 
This beautiful and exotic spice has been trading for over four thousand years. It�s actually taken from a type of crocus flower and then dried in the sun. In cooking it�s used to add both a subtle grassy, honey-like flavour and to add a gorgeous golden richness to the dish. 
As a dietary aid, it works by increasing the brain�s production of serotonin, the so-called �happiness� chemical. This helps to control cravings as these often arise out of boredom. As both an anti-depressant and an anti-carcinogenic, there is a wealth of other benefits to this extract.

5-Acai Berry: 
This berry is picked from a type of palm tree that grows all over central and south America. This supplement is made from the pulp, that part of the berry that is most nutritious. As with many other of the extracts on this list its predominant weight loss aid is that it acts by boosting your energy levels.

This helps to up your metabolism and thus burn fat at a higher rate. It has the added benefit of having anti-aging properties.

And do not forget that natural weight loss is the best way to lose weight fast, stay slim and fit always.
