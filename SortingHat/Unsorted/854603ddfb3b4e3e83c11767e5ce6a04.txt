
I�ve seen a few people post about their views on skinny shaming and I would like to say something about this because I�m getting real fed up with not saying things on this website because I�m afraid of sharing my opinions.
Skinny shaming is not at all
AT ALL 
ANYTHING LIKE fat shaming. 
People who are chubby have been looked down m and ridiculed for D E C A D E S.
It is known nationwide that fat people are supposed to be, according to media and such, the uglier and more disgusting people. Not that they are, but for years that�s what we have been told. 
So growing up in that world, 
growing up in a world that thinks you are disgusting, thinks you are undeserving of so many things
Growing up in a world who shoves super thin and beautiful models at you every fucking chance it can and tells you that you need to be like them
When you are 6 fucking years old and you know what a size 2 is and know that that�s what size the pretty people are 
Growing up in a world where you have come to hate shopping because you�ve spent hours in dressing rooms crying because clothes didn�t fit
Growing up in a world being laughed at because you were chubbier than all the other kids
Is not
AT ALL
comparable to skinny shaming.
I�m not saying it doesn�t exist or even that it�s not hurtful. But please PLEASE, stop pretending that you have it just as bad because you�re skinny because I promise you you don�t. I am 19 years old and am still messed up from years growing up as a fat kid and teenager. It�s not the same. And it�s very hurtful to say that it is because it lessens the importance of how horrible fat shaming is and how it shouldn�t exist.
I know that kids calling you too skinny, or calling you names because of your skinniness is hurtful, but it is nothing like having the whole of society and media being unaccepting of you because you�re fat.
