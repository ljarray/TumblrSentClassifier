
Triggers: Booze & Body Image- Day 4
I didn?t drink yesterday, even though I was less productive. Yay me! Still worked out (if only for 20 minutes) and cleaned. It was very hard to motivate myself to do anything without my reward system of getting completely hammered, but I did it. Today my goal (after work) is to stick to eating healthy, work out and do my hair.
Feeling very negative about my body as per usual but what can ya do.
