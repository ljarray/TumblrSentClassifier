
Thinspiration is no Worse than Fat Acceptance
I wish the pro-Ana tags weren�t limited. I know they�re not positive tags but Thinspo has been so helpful for my weight loss.

And seriously? Let�s face it: weight loss is rarely about health anyway. It�s about looking good. I wanna look good and thin-looking people keep my priorities in check.

I know it�s bad for me but I don�t care. I hate how I can�t embrace my true self on a social media site that�s all about embracing flaws.

If we have things like fat acceptance which involves accepting overweight/obese people (who may or may not have ED�s) as they are then why can�t you accept thinspiration posts? Pro-Ana tendencies aren�t healthy but neither is being overweight/obese in the long-term. Both involve detrimental ideologies but thinspo is the one that gets treated like the worse option.

Being obese is unhealthy and so is anorexic ideology. Ban them both or accept them both.
