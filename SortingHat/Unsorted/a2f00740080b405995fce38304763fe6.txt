Is anyone else bothered by the way this phrase is used and hashtagged? I have heard it used to describe highly processed meal replacements as well as Whole30/paleo eating. Personally it just makes me say �yup, I washed it.� Or it makes me think of ritually �clean� kosher or halal food.

Also equally annoying is �nourishing� which seems to be a code word for the Weston A Price or GAPS crowd. It�s cool, use your code word, but to me, any food that gives you nutrients and minerals you were lacking is �nourishing.�

I am actually quite inspired and well-served by these different eating philosophies, but the words and the way they are used just bug me sometimes.
