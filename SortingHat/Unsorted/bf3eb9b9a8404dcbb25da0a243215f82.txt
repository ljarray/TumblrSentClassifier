
All I can imagine is that it must feel so good to think of yourself as beautiful
I wanna feel like how SHE feels when she gets ready in the morning. I wanna feel good in my skin. I wanna feel like I?m beautiful and healthy and young and confident. I don?t know how to accomplish that with all the glorification of being a small sized girl. I look at my body and ALL I see is error and failure.

The standards women are given by even the ugliest looking of guys are FUCKIN RIDICULOUSLY UNATTAINABLE. I know that guys, especially guys in my age group, want a girl that looks like what they see on Instagram: flat stomach, thigh gap, big breasts, a curvy butt, and ten thousand other ?perfect? things.

I hate that I want to be wanted by a guy. It makes me feel small and vulnerable. It makes me feel pressured to lose weight and buy a membership to a tanning salon and get my nails done every 2 weeks and get a blowout every month and start posting selfies. FUCK ITS NOT POSSIBLE. AND GIRLS ON INSTAGRAM MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ITS POSSIBLE. So I always feel like I?m not doing enough and I?m less than them and as a perfectionist and people pleaser and a person with much awareness to it all, I?m never able to let it go.
