
Hi!
Hello!

So for those of you who don?t know, I?m Tori :) and, to get to the point, I have had issues with self esteem and self acceptance my entire life. I started this blog as a fitblr because I hated my body and was dedicated to losing weight for a while.

Then I slipped up and fell back into a hole of depression I tried to fill with food.

That hasn?t helped anything and I?ve come to the realization that I can?t like myself or my body only when I?m skinny. In order to be healthy in all aspects, I have to love myself to want to be healthy.

And since I?m not healthy, I need to start with love.

So this is my new journey. To find love and happiness with myself. Yes I will exercise and be mindful of food because I need that to be physically healthy but I also am working on loving myself for who I am.

I am worthy of loving myself.

And, just so you know, you are too.
