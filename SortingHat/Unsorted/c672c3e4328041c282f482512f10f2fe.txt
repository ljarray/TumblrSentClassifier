
People giving Tao shit to shut the fuck up and sit down. The people calling him a traitor and a liar have yet to think that, oh gosh, maybe oppa doesn�t want to be treated like shit by his company and that maybe oppa doesn�t want anymore critical injuries that will be pushed aside because he still needs to get his ass on stage and make money. 
Also remember when papa Huang wanted to file a lawsuit? And remember how he said that Tao didn�t want that and that he wanted to stay in exo? Do any of you remember that?

AND ALSO

some person said that tao was being selfish and that he had a �good life� in SM 

BWAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA

�he had a pretty good life�? Are you fucking kidding me? 
Ah yes nothing better than critical injuries and constant trips to the hospital.
Nothing like psychotic teenagers who don�t understand the concept of personal space. 
Nothing like racial discrimination to start off the day. 
Nothing like constantly being told you�re ugly for not meeting Korea�s beauty standards. 
Nothing like being shut out from the outside for several years with next to no contact with family and friends. 
Nothing like having your biggest fears exploited for a good laugh on TV
And nothing like losing contact with your family for so long that merely a mention of them is enough to bring you to tears. 

What a great life indeed.
