
Body Positivity
I am, at this exact moment, hotter, stronger, and generally fitter that I have ever been in my life to date.  It?s awesome, especially since when I was younger I struggled a lot with my self-image, never really believing I was pretty until a few years ago.  I was always a slightly pudgy kid, never very good a sports or particularly motivated to exercise.  Then I gained unwanted weight over freshman year, and followed that up with a summer of lifeguarding where I had to wear an unflattering swimsuit with my thighs (a long time sore sport for me) on public display every day, which made me incredibly uncomfortable.

By contrast, this last year has been an incredible turnaround for me.  New living circumstances meant that I had to bike everywhere during the school year, plus I was cooking my own food.  I lost the weight I?d gained freshman year and gained muscle and endurance.  Then I started fighting, which has really motivated me to work out in a way I never was before.  I have visible biceps for the first time in my life, and I?ve been able to last longer and longer in combat as I adjust to my sword and shield, even though both are really too heavy for someone my size.  I?m starting to see actual abs on my stomach!

I?m just really happy with the progress I?ve made this year, and I hope it continues.
