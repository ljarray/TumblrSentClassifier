
What I've Learned From Shopping Today
Why is it that we get this insane urge to shop for clothing when we?re probably at our largest, bloated, retaining water, and probably sad and depressed? I always get the urge to go get clothes when I?m PMSing, but it?s almost always a bad experience (for obvious reasons).

However, although I did look like I was pregnant, and most of the stuff I liked wasn?t fitting, I did something different than I normally do in these situations (where the normal reaction is to cry and shame myself into an oblivion.)

I looked at my thighs, butt, and tummy, and told myself, ?Okay so you?re a little larger than you want to be, but that?s ok. Remember when you left your apartment feeling like you were ready to conquer the world? Hold onto that feeling. This is only temporary. And even after your period of bloat, you?re moving in the right direction with working out again. Things will get better for you. So stop looking at the size and get yourself some skirts and shorts, girl!?

And even crazier, I believed what I was saying and left happy, having not shamed myself to feel worthless, as if the sum of my worth was tied into the size of my thighs.

Girls, remember this. You?re gorgeous, and your personality will truly shine through. No one needs to or is going to know the size of your pants unless you tell them. And what of it? Dress for you, and for how you want your clothes to fit.

Stay fabulous, ladies.
