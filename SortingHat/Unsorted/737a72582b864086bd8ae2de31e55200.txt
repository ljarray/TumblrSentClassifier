
It?s very hard to be a mixed kid in a predominately white area, but it?s even harder when you?re not conventionally attractive. I have literally heard someone say ?She must get that from her father?s side,? as if my father?s blackness is the reason behind my weight and stature, and not my upbringing and general laziness. 

So, here?s to all my fellow multiracial kids who have a hard enough time fitting into one society based on their race, and have to add to the struggle because of their bodies. It?s not fair, but I love you.
