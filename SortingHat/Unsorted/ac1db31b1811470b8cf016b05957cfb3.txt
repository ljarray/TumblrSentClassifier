
What I Eat in a Day - July 17
For breakfast today, I had a smoothie (made with 1 tbsp chia seeds, water, 1 cup frozen mixed berries and � serving of hemp protein powder) with � cup of wheat squares.

For a snack I had a green apple, some wasabi seaweed snax, and � an avocado. Actually, a pretty heavy snack but I was feeling hungry.

For lunch I made some miso soup and had a slice of whole grain bread which I dipped into my soup!

For another snack I had a frozen banana with 1 tbsp of peanut butter, and again, later, a vanilla greek yogurt with cinnamon.

For dinner I had zucchini noodles (just grate the zucchini) with 1 tbsp of both cream cheese and parmesan cheese, and I also added some spinach.

For a snack I had some frozen red grapes!

And that�s what I ate today. I was feeling kinda under the weather, and just a bit strange, so I don�t know� hopefully today is better and I want to get a little more food in me!
