
I?m doing this thing right now post-bath where I?m just lying in bed naked, which is something I?ve never done because I usually don?t like to see my naked body, but I think it?s a good exercise. If I can?t be naked alone and feel secure and content, how am I supposed to be naked with someone else and feel so? Feeling a bit chilly, but good.
