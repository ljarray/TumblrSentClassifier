
So I officially backed out of going to a beach event because of my body. And it is so crazy complicated. I like my body most days. It?s strong, and I am in love with my legs. I?m a little more than ten pounds over the weight is like to be - but I?m not even sure that that?s the problem. I would have been one of, if not the most ?physically fit? girl there. And I know this sounds stupid, but I?ve been shunned by bigger girls before. Because I?m too ?skinny? to be plus sized or curvy - and I do t know, maybe it?s a defence mechanism thing? But it sucks because I feel like I get shunned by both groups. I?m to slender to be ? cute and curvy? but I?m too big to be ?classically skinny.? My body type makes classically skinny impossible. And almost every time I look in the mirror I think that I?m not doing enough. That I should be doing more. I don?t want to fall into that hole again, but damn it, nine times outta ten I feel like I?m just looking down over the ledge.
