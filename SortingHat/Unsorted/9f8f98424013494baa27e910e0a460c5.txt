
It actually blows my mind how a white boy called me fat almost a month ago and now he has controlled my life. I never eat more than 800 calories a day and i am dropping weight very fast. I see no progress but everyone around me does. Which I?m somewhat happy about. I really do not like my body. I look at my body and disgusted is an understatement. I find myself constantly examining every curve, bump and crevice on my body. I cannot wait until I reach my GW. I can?t wait to prove everyone wrong. I can?t wait until I love myself. I am so grossed out with how fat and disgusting I am. I hate myself.
