
i am more than the curve of my hips and the softness of my skin.
my mouth can do more than kiss, and my voice sounds nice but
the words I speak are better.
my insides are made of stars and planets,
and my outside is meaningless without all the rest
i am not a black hole with nothing to give.
why can?t you see that?
