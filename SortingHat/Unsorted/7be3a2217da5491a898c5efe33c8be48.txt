
Break the Boundaries of Human Understanding
You don?t have to conform. You don?t have to be someone else. Don?t be ashamed for liking something. Screw your reputation. If you like something, do it. If you?re a tomboy and you like a few things from the girls/women?s section, don?t worry about it. Its okay to like these things. Or if you?re a lady that?s normally girly and you?re liking some of the things that are ?meant for men?, don?t think about others. Same goes for you men out there! And you gender neutral, agendered people! If you like something, that?s perfectly fine. Ignore what other people think.

Its your life and you deserve to live it as comfortably as you wish. You don?t have to sacrifice your comfort for others. The opinions of others don?t matter as much as you might think they do.

And don?t think you have to experience phases like everyone else. You can be like me and black out one day while going pastel the next, or wear a tux one day and a dress the next. Live your life on a day to day basis. AND DON?T BE ASHAMED FOR LIKING SOMETHING UNUSUAL. Wear those nerdy T-shirts with inside jokes on them! Wear that lolita stuff and WORK IT! Wear the clothes that people think only belong at Ren Fairs or in Sci-Fi movies. Wear the stuff you happened to like from a past generation! AND YOU KNOW WHAT? ACT LIKE THE PERSON YOU THINK YOU ARE ON THE INSIDE! SPEAK IN WAYS SOME DON?T UNDERSTAND!

You don?t have to live your life based on the others around you! Break the human expectation of conformity. Be yourself. Because you are beautiful. Everything about you is beautiful. You are all precious and strong and amazing individuals.
