
Day 2
Today I�m feeling pretty sluggish and tired. I took a solid 2 hour nap with my cuddly little doxy. I�m going to try to make it to TRX class in 2 hours. 

Breakfast: 1 egg, 1 egg white scrambled with sweet potatoes, spinach, and a little bit of salmon.

Lunch: Whole30 approved meatloaf with sweet potato fries and a small spinach salad.

Dinner: Salmon with guacamole topping on a bed of spinach.

Snack: A few pistachios. 

I�ve been drinking matcha pretty much all day to try to help the detox I�m feeling. It�s been a better day for me depression-wise, though. I�m not looking forward to work tomorrow but I know if I prepare well that I have zero excuses to eat well all day. 

The meatloaf I made was a combination of these two recipes:

Going through this challenge I�m trying to pay very close attention to how I feel since I would like to repeat the Whole30 as a vegetarian and will obviously be making some alterations.
