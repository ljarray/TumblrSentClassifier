
What I Eat in a Day - July 14
For breakfast I had a homemade yogurt parfait ice pop, using vanilla greek yogurt, � cup rolled oats, and 1 cup of frozen mixed berries. I sprinkled some cinnamon on top.

For a snack I ate some frozen banana slices with 1 tbsp of peanut butter.

For lunch I made an omelet, using 2 eggs, spinach, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika and � tbsp coconut oil to cook it. (I mixed the hot sauce with my eggs - my omelet was orange!)

For a snack I had an apple with cinnamon, and later, a coffee and vanilla greek yogurt ice pop (with coconut sugar) that I didn�t finish�

For dinner I made some soup, using spelt spaghetti noodles, 1 tbsp soy sauce (mixed with about one cup of water for broth), with some green onion and broccoli. 

And for a snack, I had � a packet of a Kashi quinoa granola bar (there are 2 bars per packet) and a cup of boiled unsweetened almond milk with cinnamon.

And that�s what I ate!
