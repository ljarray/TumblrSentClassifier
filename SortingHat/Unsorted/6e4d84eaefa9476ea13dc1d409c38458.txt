
Training and diet miscellany
(1) Trying not to get my hopes up* but I am feeling cautiously optimistic after a nice squat session yesterday
*i.e. trying not to forget that training will be hard and I will not ever make that much progress 

(2) I may have reached the end of my reverse dieting but we have to see:

3 weeks ago: avg weight was 143.5
2 weeks ago: avg weight was 142.8 
This past week: back at 143.3 (and the past few days have been between 143.6 and 144)

?plus I am have noticed a small but perceptible increase in my overall squishiness or ?flan-itude.? Coach said we should keep intake the same for the week and see if my weight stabilizes (which is fine because I?m not hurting for food), and that eating more carbs can cause some water retention? which is not the greatest because flaniness was high to begin with but that?s better than fat and I?m not putting on a swimsuit anytime soon anyways? which is why before a show you see people carb deplete and then reiintroduce carbs to get some fullness to their muscles (god bodybuilding must be so fucking awful). 

Anyways, that means that starting out my cut I was maintaining 160-162 lbs and eating an average of 2400 calories a day. I am now weighing <144 lbs and (hypothetically) maintaining that at an average of 2280 calories a day. If I decide to bulk a teensy bit, I could potentially very gradually get my intake up into the low 2300s, and that would make it easier for the next time I want to cut (i.e. more food and more muscle mass). Or y?know maybe the body positive stuff will finally work on me, and I will just learn to love and accept my body unconditionally, but that seems less likely in the next 6-12 months.
