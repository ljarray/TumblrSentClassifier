
Worst part of my ED- keep this in mind before you post your pro ED rubbish.
My ED had many miserable parts but by far the worst was my nails.
I didn�t experience hair loss as much as I do nail loss. I lost I think 2-3 toenails in the year or so I suffered, and so many more fingernails.
I also suffer anxiety & one of my nervous habits is nail picking and biting and my nails were so weak that it was so easy to take off massive chunks of fingernails at once and once I started I just couldn�t seem to stop myself.
The little white bit at the base of your nail, the half moon. Yeah. Mine seemed to start rotting at the base and of course hello constant anxiety, I picked & picked at it & I have no idea what part of the nail I left exposed but it was INCREDIBLY painful and it got infected so easily. It literally kept me up for a WHOLE NIGHT once, I was exhausted, naturally but it was the pain that kept me up the most. I did that a lot of times but this time for some reason it was remarkably excruciating.

I felt disgusted with myself and I was in such a huge amount of pain and it took forever to heal because of my poor health.

Remember this before you post your pro ana crap, just don�t.
