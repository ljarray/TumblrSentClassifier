
So I think I want to cut my hair off again. 
I did it in early 2014, and I loved it. And then my BPD began disabling and it caused me to have a weird identity crisis and hate myself deeply for no real reason for such a long time. I?ve spent so much time growing it out, it?s down to my shoulders now. But I don?t like it. It bothers me and I don?t even do anything with it. When I look into the future, the person I want to be always has short hair. But my mom and everyone else wants it to be long still and like? What if it makes me have another weird identify crisis? It was a large part of 2014 Hell Summer, I blame it 100% on BPD but like? I don?t want to go through ?You can?t be xyz because your hair is short and you?re ugly.? I want short hair but I?m scared of it backfiring on me.
