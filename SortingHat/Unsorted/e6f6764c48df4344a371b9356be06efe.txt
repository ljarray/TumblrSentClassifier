Dinner: Almond-stuffed, 4 bacon-wrapped dates, 2 buffalo drumsticks, and carrots and celery dipped in homemade paleo ranch dressing. 

The weekends are the hardest for me. I just want to eat all the things and have a drink�but I�m being good. We�re watching Ronda�s fight at home and I made homemade paleo ranch dressing with buffalo drumsticks, celery, carrots, and almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. I probably overate slightly, but it was all compliant at least. And it�s nothing compared to the binges I have been having every weekend until now. I feel like I�ve really made progress already and I�m so glad�the binging was leaving me with such guilt and shame, not to mention feeling awful physically. 

I took another rest day since I got super crappy sleep last night and I prefer to do a long run on Sunday anyways. We did our super long Saturday morning walk with the dogs to our favorite Jewish bakery. For almost every Saturday morning for the past several months I get a piece of their heavenly carrot cake�Today I drank black coffee (I usually do, but with something sweet to compliment) and watched my husband eat a slice. I�m super proud of myself :) 

Also, hubby and me splurged and got a SodaStream so we can make all kinds of sparkling water. Suddenly it�s not so hard to drink enough water! I�m excited to experiment with different infusions such as cucumber, lemon, fruit, etc. And someday when I�ve got my shit together, we can actually make soda once in a while :) But without all the nasty stuff added.
