
Some people don�t understand
Constantly feeling like you�re fat and ugly literally is one of the worst feelings for a teenage girl. You all of a sudden rethink everything, talk yourself out of talking to him. You dont want to go shopping because you dont want to try on the clothes. The reason it takes so long in the morning is because you�re trying to find something that hides you rather than makes you stand out. And the worst part is, you know you can do something about it.
