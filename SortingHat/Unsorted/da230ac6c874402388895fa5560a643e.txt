
Day 2: Gwangju and Damyang
(Warning: Super long post with lots of photos)

Having been to the Seoul Express Bus Terminal once already yesterday, getting there was a breeze today. Woke up in the morning dreading the morning crowd and having to lug my luggage around, but turns out I reached the terminal an hour early. Instead of waiting around, I went to the counter and requested to change my ticket for the earlier bus which departs in 20 minutes and the lady changed it for me. No harm trying, I�m sure the staff there would change your tickets for you if there�s vacancies. 

And also, I used this website (https://www.hticket.co.kr/) to check the bus timings and price before I bought my ticket. You probably need to know a bit of Korean to be able to select your location and stuff. Knowing how poor I am, I chose the cheaper bus which was still good. And you have to be really really exact with the timing when you tell the person at the counter, because if you say for example, the bus for Busan around 10am, there�s probably a few buses with few minutes difference in timing but huge difference in price. 


Moving on, I changed my ticket to an earlier timing. And when you board the bus, you have to scan the QR-code on the ticket, which will then be registered on the screen (as can be seen below). Your seat will then change from blue to red, which means that it is occupied. Oh, and lucky me got a empty seat beside me, so yes I got two seats for the price of one. 



The interesting thing about taking bus from cities to cities is that you get to stop over at the rest stations along the way and buy yummy food. And it�s cheaper by bus than by train/plane. The journey from Seoul to Gwangju is about 3h10mins by bus and roughly a bit less by train. So yea, not worth it taking KTX in my opinion. 10 minutes for you to queue and buy your hot dog and go to the toilet before the bus leaves. 




Taking the express bus, you would arrive at U-Square in Gwangju which is the bus terminal, a major bookstore, CGV (their movie theater), restaurants and everything combined. Basically, if your bus is a few hours later, you won�t be bored as there�s so many things to do here. It is even connected to the Shinsegae Department Store and the E-mart.


From here, cross over to the urban bus terminal where you take local buses to places like Damyang etc. And just in case you take out your T-money to tap on the bus, they don�t use it here. Probably another different card, but if you are just here for 2 days or so, just pay cash which is only about 100won more expensive each trip.

So I took bus 9 to my hostel - The Lounge, and got off one stop earlier because of the wrong information on the Airbnb website. Asked around and in the end, went to the police station and the ahjussi policeman helped me to call the hostel staff. And the room is all mine tonight, no one around but there�s nothing but a miserable fan and also a mosquito or two. I feel itchy while typing this now.  



Next up, go back to U-Square taking the same bus which cost a flat 1200won per ride. Plan was to go to Damyang, which is about 45 minutes away by bus. Take bus 311 to Juknokwon (???) which is the bamboo garden - Damyang is famous for being a bamboo haven. The bus ride cost 2,800won. It�s probably the last stop where everyone will alight. The moment the bus left the station, it began to rain heavily :o Good thing I brought my umbrella. 


Upon reaching Juknokwon, you will see these pandas. Cross the road and you will see the stairs up, feel free to take a few selfies/selcas with your buddy/other half/family. 



As it was drizzling, everyone was carrying their umbrella or wearing their cute raincoats/ponchos. Maybe it was because of the rain, but it was very cooling inside the bamboo garden. Oh right, the ticket cost 3,000won now, an increase in price compared to when I saw someone�s blog. 

It�s definitely a nice place to go for a date, taking selfies with your other half with every single bamboo tree. And also for some family fun.








Told you it was a good place for couples hahaha.


Next stop would be the Metasequoia-lined road. After exiting Juknokwon, you kind of have to walk quite a distance. There will be maps around, so I�m sure you can find it just by looking for the nice looking trees. Frankly, I�m not sure how I walked so far, but yes, just be careful when you take photos and selfies on the road. There�s another part of the road where you can cycle, but I did not walk till the end, so i just took photos when there wasn�t any cars. 



When in Korea, eat kimchi. When in Damyang, eat bamboo ice cream. Even though the flavour wasn�t very strong, but ice cream is always good. 


Took the same bus 311 back to U-Square and began to explore. Forgot to take photos of the YoongPoong Bookstore, but look, a giant moomin at CGV to make up for it. And that Minions cup and also the Pokemon cup! Why can�t they have such awesome stuff in Singapore? They don�t, right? I also like how they have brochures(?) for the different movies available which you can take home even if you are not watching that particular movie. It�s like a mini poster in a flyer form. 





The food street list! 


Don�t ask me why there�s dinosaurs in the mall, but selfie time!! (Puts head into T-Rex�s jaws)



And if you are too lazy to go to the stadium, you can watch your baseball match right outside U-Square. Not many people though. 



Finally a proper dinner. Doenjang Jjigae for 6,000won from the food court at U-Square. Oh wait, it�s only day 2. Time to eat ramen and kimbab everyday to save money. 

And look, the area around my hostel looks like a mini Myeongdong, which I would explore tomorrow after my day trip to Boseong. Not sure if it�s worth going so far just to see a tea plantation, but I will decide tomorrow morning! 


You can tell, I actually wrote less details towards the end because I�m so tired and lazy hahaha. But I will try my best! Tomorrow is gonna be another long day to Boseong.
