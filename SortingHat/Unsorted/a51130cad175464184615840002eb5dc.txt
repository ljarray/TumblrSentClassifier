
Week 4 Resisting Temptation [August 11-18]

Ever notice that when you�re eating healthier, you just don�t really WANT the unhealthy stuff? I mean, there are definitely exceptions, but I have been much better able to keep myself from reaching for that cookie sitting on the plate in front of me while I�m in a meeting, or that piece of Dove dark chocolate that a colleague is offering. In the past, I�ve been at that place before. But more recently, prior to this journey, I had gotten to where I had NO willpower for resistance. I would grab several peanut M&M�s, grab a Friday doughnut that the school principal had brought in, eat a piece of chocolate cake that my friend had grabbed for me when she bought her school lunch, etc. All in the same day. No wonder I had ballooned up! Now, I�m not saying that I�ll never have any of that stuff again. That�s not realistic. And really, cheat meals/days are pretty much endorsed in most weight loss methods. But it�s limited to one day or meal. Not all of them.

This week I cheated a little bit at an anniversary party for my grandparents (65 years!). I did notice that I was full pretty quickly, though, in comparison to what I normally could eat. And when I had a piece of cake, which was good, I didn�t even want to eat the whole thing. I was satisfied with about half a piece, so I stopped. It�s all about moderation and good choices.




Although this is the fourth week of my journey to be fit, it�s only the second week of my PiYo workout. At the beginning of this week, I noticed that I didn�t feel the sore muscles as much as I had last week, so I knew I needed to step up my game a bit and push harder during my workout. It�s helping that the routines are getting more familiar, so I�m able to work harder and not have to spend time looking up trying to figure out what I�m supposed to be doing. But the actual schedule keeps changing, and I�m thinking as I progress further, the program will become a bit more difficult. But I�ve made steady progress, still, so I guess that is good. Even though I know people would not really notice much difference in me, I feel it. And I feel the increased flexibility. Overall, I just feel good. And that�s reason enough for me to keep going.
