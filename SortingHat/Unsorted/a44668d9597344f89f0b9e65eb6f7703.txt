
Like the thing about people�s arguments against the campaigns saying �love yourself, accept yourself the way you are, you�re beautiful� is that it�s the easy way out. I constantly see people saying that these campaigns and the accompanying photos of big women are promoting unhealthy eating habits and encouraging others to be overweight.
Apparently when people are overweight they are immediately cast into the category of disgusting/gross/horrible/unhealthy.
BUT THAT IS YOUR OWN DAMN OPINION OF SOMEONES OUTWARD APPEARANCE. BECAUSE GUESS WHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT ARE NOT ALWAYS UNHEALTHY
AND
PEOPLE WHO ARE THIN OR UNDERWEIGHT ARE NOT ALWAYS HEALTHY EITHER. SO FUCK OFF.
BECAUSE I NEEDED THESE CAMPAIGNS WHEN I WAS LITTLE SO THAT MAYBE I WOULDN�T HAVE STARVED MYSELF FOR ALL OF 2006. MAYBE I WOULDN�T HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF BEING FAT BECAUSE I FELT THAT BEING FAT WAS THE WORST THING YOU COULD BE!
I WOULD�VE LOVED TO BE TAUGHT THAT MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE WAS NOT HOW I SHOULD DETERMINE MY SELF WORTH.
So, how about we stop telling people what�s best for them and just try to support and love others the best we can? It�s not that hard.
