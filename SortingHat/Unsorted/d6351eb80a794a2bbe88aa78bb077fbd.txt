
�If we love ourselves based on others� love for us, all we love is an opinion. Not flesh and bones, blood and heartbeat; not the soul or the warmth that we emanate as living beings, but just words. Words that are so inconsequential, that matter so little in the end that we can�t even take them with us to the grave.�
� 	M. Ocean
