&nbsp; The wedding date is approaching and you need to know how to lose weight fast for the wedding. I know you want to look the best in the world on this special day and I want to share with you some tips on how you can drop each additional pound of your body! Begin! Cardio is great, but interval training are much better and can burn all the fat cells of your body in much shorter time. Basically, it goes like this: one minute is running at normal speed and the second minute you give your best sprint. It is recommended to repeat this 8 times and do 4 times a week! However, you must be in base form or simply will not be able to complete this training. If you are not in the way you can stick with regular cardio exercises like running or cycling � 45 minutes 4 times a week will be excellent and efficient too! Proper nutrition � you know that to lose weight you need to eat healthily. Stop eating junk food, chocolate and foods high in fat! It is only by reducing unnecessary and empty calories being cut about 500 calories per day. We must stick to it, or you will not be able to lose weight fast for the wedding! Another good option is to follow a system based on the foods that burn fat diet. These diet plans that show you how you can easily increase your metabolism and manipulate your fat burning hormones eating the right foods! Do not worry, it is completely safe! The best of these plans is actually fat much faster than other diets and exercises burn. The only thing I do not like is that you need to add more food to your daily menu!

No matter how you choose, stick to it until you see the results, because if you do it right, you will see great changes! Take my congratulations and good luck!
