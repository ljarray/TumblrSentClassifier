
This morning I tried a matcha latte ice blended with almond milk (which is basically an iced latte but you stick it in a blender) and it was great! It�s definitely a different taste that you have to get used to though for sure.

I was at the doctor by one of my favorite breakfast taco places and I wanted one so badly, but I�ve been off my clean eating game and I want to feel healthier again, so I resisted.

That�s my morning update. Hope yall are swell! ??
