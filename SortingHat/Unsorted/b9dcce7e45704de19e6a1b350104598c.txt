
Now that I?m actually losing weight I can instantly feel results when it comes to getting out of breath/back pains from walking a lot?? It?s amazing I?ve walked 13+ miles and bowled for 6+ hours (in the last 2 day) and I feel great I literally was able to go for an extra 3 mile walk after practice today
