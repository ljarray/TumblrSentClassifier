As women, our bodies are under extremely close inspection from not only our male counterparts, but other women as well. The expectations are set very high, and as a result, our society is deemed to have an obsession with the ?ideal body type?. But when I think of the word ideal, I think of a body type that will fulfill the needs of the person to the highest extent possible. For me, thick thighs and a strong core, along with strong arms and broad shoulders, are parts of my ideal body type bc they help me do my job and make me feel good and strong. But that is not the body type that is represented by the media or apparently desired by the typical man.

But if I were to have the 'ideal body type?, I would be unable to perform and therefore, wouldn?t have the ideal body for what I do.

I still don?t understand why having a thinner and less muscular frame is the desired look, bc although it works for some, and looks very nice, a muscular, or fat, or tall and slim, or simply slightly chubby frame works just as well for someone else, and therefore is ideal bc it fulfills the needs of that individual. Not everyone has the same requirements of their body, so having one ideal body type doesn?t make any sense.
