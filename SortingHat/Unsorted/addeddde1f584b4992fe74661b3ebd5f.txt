
Fretting the Freshmen 15?
Anyone else about to start college in August? I created this fitblr in order to create a supporting community for those just beginning or trying to maintain healthy lifestyles while in college/having busy schedules. Iï¿½ll be posting everything from quick, healthy, and easy meals to workouts for small spaces and apartments. I am also available to help you plan your ideal schedule for balancing classes, work, and health.
