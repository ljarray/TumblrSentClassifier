I was just looking at pictures of Runyon Canyon and I saw people having fun and hiking in just sports bras and yoga pants. Ya know, just normal hiking attire. Me myself, I?m a bit insecure. I have stretch marks, I?m not as pretty as girls I see, and I don?t fit ?the image.? But looking at those pictures I thought to myself, ?Why I am afraid to be proud of my body?? 

I mean this is the body I will live in my whole life. There is no need for me to be ashamed of it. Sure, I?m not a size 0 or 2, but does that mean I shouldn?t wear crop tops, or tight dresses? I can wear whatever I want. As long as YOU feel comfortable, wear whatever you want. If you want to buy that cute dress but you aren?t sure how?ll you look, buy it. Because as long YOU think that YOU look amazing, that?s all that matters. I mean that?s what it?s all about in the end. It?s all about YOU. If you want to eat a pizza, do it. If you want to buy a crop top but you don?t think you have the right body type, just screw it and buy the crop top. I bet you?ll look gorgeous. 

Don?t worry about what others think. Don?t stress about fitting ?the image.? Because in reality while there might be a certain size or shape that seems ?healthy? and ?beautiful,? it may not be for everyone. 

So always remember that all decisions start and end with you. Love your body. Be confident in your own skin! In fact, just writing this made me feel a whole lot better about my body. 

Don?t let anyone bring you down. YOU control you body. YOUR body is YOURS. Be proud of it.
