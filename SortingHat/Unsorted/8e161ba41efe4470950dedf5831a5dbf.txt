So on my first blog I used to post daily tips and tricks, and on my last blog a lot of followers asked me to start posting them again. So I�ve decided to do that. So this is the first edition of the daily tips and tricks! I hope it helps and if there is anything specific you need help (reducing binges, healthy snacks, workouts etc) on send me an ask and I�ll cover it in tips and tricks daily post!

[e a t i n g] 
O1. Make SMALLER PORTIONS. Less food, less temptation.
O2. EAT ON SMALLER PLATES and bowls, and use smaller forks and spoons etc. when you use smaller utensils or eat off smaller dish wear then smaller portions look bigger. It may seem silly but you can actually trick your brain into thinking it�s getting more than it actually is. 
O3. TAKE SMALLER BITES AND CHEW SLOWER. You don�t need to take large bites and when you take small bites and chew them slower it takes you longer to eat and you fill up faster, therefore eating less. Some people find it effective to chew a specific number of times before swallowing. Softer foods around 15 times before swallowing (like fruits and veggies) and more substantial foods 27-30 times before swallowing (like meats). 
There are major health benefits associated with thoroughly chewing your food. For example the more you chew the smaller the food particles which makes it easier for the digestion process to absorb nutrients from the food. That basically means you get more energy from a smaller amount of food. Also studies have shown that the longer you chew the more you enjoy the taste and the more satisfied you are with your meal. This can help prevent binge eating, because you feel satisfied with what you�ve eaten and don�t go looking for more food to curb your hunger! 
O4. EAT AROUND OTHER PEOPLE. Eating around other people encourages you to eat healthier because you are being watched. Also it can help to stop you from bingeing because you don�t want to binge in front of someone. 
O5. DRINK WATER. Try and drink a glass of water before every meal, as well as sip water throughout meals. It will help you feel full faster. Also staying hydrated can help prevent cravings! 
O6. USE DARK DISHES. I don�t now why but lighter dishes apparently make you want to eat more. So stick to dark colours. 
O7. CHOOSE FOODS TO BOOST YOUR METABOLISM. There are many foods that naturally boost your metabolism. Go here for a list of 18 foods that you can add to your meals http://bembu.com/metabolism-boosting-foods
O8. WAIT 2O MINUTES. After you�ve finished eating wait 20 minutes. It takes this long for the stomach to realize that it�s full.

That�s it for today! Hope it helps beauties. Sweetly,??k x
