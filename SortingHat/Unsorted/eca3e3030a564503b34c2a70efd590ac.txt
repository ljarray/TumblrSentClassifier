
Thoughts on loving yourself.
I spend so much time scrutinising myself in mirror, pointing out all my flaws, wishing this wouldn?t stick out or that was a bit thinner. When I look at a picture of myself the first thing that comes into my head isn?t what looks nice it?s what doesn?t look nice and what needs changing. It?s crazy how much we bring ourselves down. And for what? To feel like shit? To make other people happy? I do it, but I don?t know why ?
But then if we were to say what we do like about ourselves, what we do think is sexy, or cute or, pretty we are vain and self-obsessed? Why is everyone so quick to criticise self love and brand it as egotistical? Why can?t you be happy with how you look? The media go on and on about how to look good or your best self, but when we begin to realise it ourselves suddenly it?s a sin?
Even when we do post pictures (ones we may like) it usually comes with a negative comment that a) we think is true or b) we say because we don?t want people to think we are vain. Why is it more accepted and ?humble? to say negative stuff about ourselves than positive?? 
There?s too much shit already in this world so why not make your little bubble golden? 
Next time you post a picture and think your makeup looks good, or your smile is cute. State it. Be proud of it. Be proud of you. There will always be arseholes who get enjoyment out of bringing you down, don?t be one of them. Because at the end of the day life is too short and you are too beautiful. 
I?m not saying I think I?m God or a statue carved by angels. Hell no! It?s hard to learn to accept yourself, I am no way near the finish line. It takes time. But just be comfortable. Live for you. Because the person who deserves the most love from you, is you. 
You are amazing, go and show the world! ??????
