
If trying on ill fitting dresses compulsively for 2 hours looks fun to you in a movie montage, let me assure you that it is not. Especially if it?s from midnight to 2 in the morning and you can?t stop and you don?t think ?I look disgusting in this dress,? you think ? I am a disgusting, worthless person and nothing apparently can hide that.?

Calm down, Amy. Breathe. You are in emotion mind. This will pass.
