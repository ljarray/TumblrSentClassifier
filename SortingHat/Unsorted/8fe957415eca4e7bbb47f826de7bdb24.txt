Day Five on the Cleanse was Weird but Satisfying  


Yesterday was weird on the cleanse just like Tuesday. Yesterday I was allowed to consume a cup of rice and six tomatoes. After every tomatoe I had to drink a glass of water due to the acid.      I thought this was weird and this was more restrictive then Tuesday. I thought I was going to fail at this but I was surprised. I did not feel really hungry yesterday except the end of my shift at work.ï¿½
