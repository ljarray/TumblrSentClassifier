
I legitimately hate myself today :(((( I just got my senior pics back and I can?t believe how?. large I look. I hate it I hate everything I just want to cry. why do I think that I?m even remotely ok looking because I?m not.

I hate having my picture taken. I hate it. I hate seeing what other people see.
