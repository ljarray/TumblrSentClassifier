
I woke up to a two lbs loss. Thank you fucking god.
Maybe this has all just been hormones and bloating and i am going back to normal.
I am now only five lbs away from what i was a month ago before this hell in my body started.

Yesterday i ate around 1500 calories. I am disappointed in that but i lost two lbs anyway. 
I am not supposed to be working out for another week and a day but i did anyway. I did 15 minutes of yoga in the afternoon and then 20 minutes of light cycling and then about an hour of flow yoga and meditation for the full moon

Also�i.lost.two.lbs.

I am so happy about that.

I havent eaten any solids since 1:30 yesterday afternoon so i am going to try and fast for a full 24 today. I�ll be at work so itll be easy.

And last my bf is acting up. Its so out of his character it really has me worried. And now im not going to see him tonight. And its sick because i can only think about weighing in the morning and that makes it ok.
