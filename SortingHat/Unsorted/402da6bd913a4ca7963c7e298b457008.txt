
You met me as something

I never connected with

My designated sex

Has always left me uncomfortable

The older I got

The worse the disconnection became

I could stare in the mirror

Grab portions of my body

Press them flat against my chest

Until they didn?t exist

I could fake being male

I could fake being something other than myself

The disassociation became too much to bare

Until there were stretches of time

Where the time disappeared

At great lengths

I forgot who I was

I would wake up

In someone else?s house

Unsure of who I was

Unsure of how I got there

There were times

I would arrive at streets

I never knew existed

Because I couldn?t bare

Knowing I was destined to be in a body

That betrayed me day in and day out
