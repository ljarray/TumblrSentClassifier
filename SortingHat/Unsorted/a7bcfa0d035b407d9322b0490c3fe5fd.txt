
Amy Shumer Is My Hero: How She Taught Me to Love Myself
Hello Healthy State University Students,

Before seeing the new film �Trainwreck� the other day with my boyfriend, we sat down in a mall food court that we frequent on a regular basis. Neither of us had seen the film or any of Amy Shumer�s work, but we discussed how she had a reputation for being fat. My boyfriend defended her saying he didn�t understand the comments and wouldn�t consider her fat at all. I too had heard that she was �fat�, and new that was a platform for many of her jokes. I honestly was not as hopeful as my boyfriend. I thought, based on word, that she was on the heavier side. That is what the media, and everyone else I had talked to lead me to believe. This was all being discussed while I myself ate fast food orange chicken and Dots candy. Funny how we people judge others for sins we commit ourselves-huh.

           After all the credits the film began, and I leaned over to my boyfriend and said, �WHAT!? She�s not fat at all!� He took the opportunity to gloat. He told me so. I laughed through the whole movie admiring the talent of the cast (especially Shumer and Hader). However, I was put off by jokes about her weight and her looks. Amy Shumer is beautiful and by no means should be called fat- on or off screen. **SPOILER ALERT** The scene that stuck with me most was the last scene where Amy comes out as a cheerleader and tries (and fails) to keep up with professional cheerleaders all in an elaborate scheme to win back Hader�s character.

           Okay, sure. She isn�t a size 2 like the other cheerleaders, but she by no means stuck out (weight wise, her moves were the only reason I could keep track of which cheerleader was her!). She didn�t look drastically different from the rest of the girls. She looked hot!

           I decided to look into Shumer a little more. I tried to find on the internet her dress size (pretty disgusting that this information is available online for the whole world to access). The internet claims she is a size 6. A SIZE 6. Let me jut repeat once more- A FREAKING SIZE 6. That�s fat? Are you kidding me? Hollywood has really screwed up our perception of what it means to be fat. A size 6 is way less than the average dress size for a woman. Most woman fall around a size 10. Being a size 6 I felt pretty bad about myself. Was I fat? I never considered myself skinny, but I never thought my size was fat enough to be criticized by the public.

During my research, I stumbled on articles about film critics criticizing her looks and her weight, but of course not her performance because no body cares about how a woman performs in a movie as long as she looks good. Shumer responded with a naked photo of herself, and lots of comments on interviews about body positivity. Shumer honestly made me feel better about myself. The pictures of her online are stunning, and I would be happy to look like her. Online research also revealed that Shumer had lost weight for the role-which to me doesn�t make sense. Being heavier was vital to her character, and to the themes of the film. The film teaches that there is something beautiful about just being yourself and loving yourself. It seems that Shumer lives by this message and spouts these ideas in her comedy. Rock on Amy- you make me feel beautiful! Let the haters hate, and love yourself.

Actresses like Amy Shumer are few and far between and hope someday we will get more beautiful actresses like her. 

Peace+Love+Health,
