
Corporate pigs
You?re to fat,
You?re to thin,
In this age will we ever win?
Stick like idols,
Corporate ghosts,
The fake imagery, that we follow the most, 
Look what you?ve done,
Look what you made.
A generation that is way too afraid,
We?re sick and were starving,
We eat and we?re sick.
Because of the assholes that all act like pricks,
Because Of the models,
The ?standards? ?we? have,
I am sick of your comments,
I?m sick of your view,
Just look at yourselves,
With shame as I do,

For all those who wish to be a size 8,
Your wonderful humans and I bet you look great,
The business the money, their all greedy pigs.
For those who try and make us 
sick. little. sticks.
