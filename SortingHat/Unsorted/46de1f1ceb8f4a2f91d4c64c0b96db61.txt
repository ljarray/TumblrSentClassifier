
it?s so strange to me that i have more confidence in my body now at a size 12 than i did 8 years ago when i was a size 6.

i?m not saying i?m healthier at a 12, because i?m definitely not (i really shouldn?t be over an 8 or 10) but somehow i?m more okay with my stretchmarks and tummy rolls now. it?s probably the fact that i have a lot more of them than i did when i was 15 and healthy but i was constantly covering up my stomach back then. we?d go to the beach and i?d wearing a bikini and look amazing, but the moment we sat down on our towels i would wrap my arms around my stomach or find an excuse to throw my tank top back on so no one could see the normal rolls in my stomach when i slouched. i carry the majority of my weight in my stomach. i always have and i always will. it kinda sucks to be honest.

i don?t know if it?s because i?m older and body-image is less of an issue for me or because i?ve followed so many blogs who are also body-positive and and stuff (it?s probably that tbh) but i?m okay with my body. sure, it would be much better for me if i was at a lower weight and i?d be healthier and stuff but i?m okay at the weight i?m at. i haven?t gained anymore weight and i?m actually slowly (very slowly) loosing it. i actually enjoy looking at the stretchmarks on my thighs. the ones on my hips are still thick and bruise colored, but the ones on my thighs are thin and light and can only be seen if you?re really looking for them. they look like flashes of lighting. sure there are more of them than i?d like, but they?re there so what are you gonna do. you might as well embrace ?em.
