Maybe those men, who said women having body hair is not natural, will finally shut up if we can persuade them to wax their body hair and finally feel how painful it is.

On the other note, sugaring is an almost pain-free alternative to hard/soft waxing or shaving. It?s also better for sensitive skin? The problem is it?s about $30-40 more expensive and finding an expert is quite hard. :/
