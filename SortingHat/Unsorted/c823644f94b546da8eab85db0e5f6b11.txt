Yes! I was a bit more active today, I cleaned my room and I am happy my intake was what I am supposed to get in which is 1,300 calories. Yay pain is better now which I am happy about. I weighed in today at 162.5 which is so close to my first goal weight! So in 6 days I have lost a little under a pound! great :)
