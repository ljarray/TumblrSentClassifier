
Another day, another gothic style blog unfollowed
Look. If you are going to publish goth scene kids? selfies that show them looking like skeletal waifs, and include their ?OMG I?m so fat today? commentary, then I AM NOT HERE FOR THAT. Ever. You know that a lot of goth scene aesthetic bullshit perpetuates and romanticizes body image problems and disordered eating, right?? FUCK THAT. You can have your cute goth style without encouraging mental illness and a disordered lifestyle. Stop promoting this fucked-up nonsense, please. Too many of us are already fighting against a warped self-perception. You are making this fight more difficult when you publish commentary like this as an accessory to gothic style photos!
