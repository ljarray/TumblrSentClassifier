
Day 32: cardio schmardio
I haven�t done cardio is so long. And it�s not that I hate cardio but I dislike it very strongly because that is when I feel most out of shape.

I�m a naturally heavy breather so when I do cardio I get super self conscious about my breathing cause I feel like I�m breathing ten times harder then everyone else haha

But today I did cardio and I felt really good! I felt like I could keep going and I felt like I didn�t need to slow down as often as I usually would have. It felt really great! And today was just an all around good day for me.
