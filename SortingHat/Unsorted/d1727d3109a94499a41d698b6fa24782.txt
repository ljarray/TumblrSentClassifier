
Day 28: week 4 done
So we have done it guys! All the way to week four! I won�t be able to do a weigh in until tomorrow, but I will let you know how much progress we have made. I feel good! And a lot of people say I look good so I feel like I�m slowly but surely making some head way! Yay!!!

Also, I tried to go to that yoga studio by my aunt�s house and it was fucking closed! Who the hell is closed on a Saturday? I was really confused but I managed to do some yoga the morning when I got back from the yoga studio so at least there is that.

I hope you all had a wonderful day today!
