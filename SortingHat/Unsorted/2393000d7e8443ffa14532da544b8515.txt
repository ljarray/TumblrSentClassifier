
So let?s make it clear guys
Pictures are pictures, they are not reality. 

Here is my stomach when I am standing and stretching, like real hard


here is my stomach when I?m just sitting normally


here are my legs when I put myself in a very uncomfortable position, I bend foward as much as I can and turn my legs in slightly


and here are my legs when I just stand normally


Don?t believe what you see on the internet, or on the magazines. Not only do they do that kind of thing, but they also use photoshop. You are beautiful and the things that society teach you not to like on yourself are human, and natural.
