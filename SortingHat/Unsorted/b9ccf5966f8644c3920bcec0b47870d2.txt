
Like on one hand I totally love my body and every little imperfection it has; I?m not ashamed of it in any way. But when it come to having sex and other people touching me???..my brain does a complete 180 now. It just goes ?LOL NOPE REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME WHERE YOUR EX LIED?? NOW WE?RE GONNA LOOSE ALL CONFIDENCE BECAUSE WE CAN?T TRUST ANYONE TO BE TRUTHFUL AND LOOK LIKE AN INSECURE BABY?
