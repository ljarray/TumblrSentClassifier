
completed my first resistance training of the 2nd week of BBG
Kayla�s guide is kicking my butt, but only a week in and I can already feel my legs and butt getting tighter and stronger. I�ve noticed less cellulite in particular. I�m not following the food plan exactly, but I am eating very healthy. I haven�t had a cheat meal for the week yet because I don�t want any bad cravings to come back. Every day I look forward to my next workout. If you haven�t started Kayla�s guide I highly recommend you do. So far I�m loving it!
