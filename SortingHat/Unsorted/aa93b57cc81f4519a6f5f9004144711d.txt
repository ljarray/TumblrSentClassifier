
What to purge, and what not to purge!
I�ve been seeing these kinds of posts on pro ana/mia accounts and they�re a bit inaccurate so here is my own two cents.

Things you shouldn�t purge:

Bread products: they are delicious and contain lots of carbohydrates your body needs to function optimally!
Chocolate, sweets, ice cream, etc: you deserve to eat �junk food� if you really want it. Listening to your cravings isn�t a bad thing, and all food, in moderation, is healthy for your body. Food and guilt shouldn�t be related at all!
Fruits and Vegetables: they are full of important vitamins and minerals that your body needs to survive and not get deficiencies that could put you in the hospital! They also contain protein and carbohydrates!
Actually, you shouldn�t purge any food you�ve eaten� Eating is not a crime and you should not feel the need to compensate for having eaten �too much�. You will just feel worse. Trust me, it is not worth it.
Things you absolutely SHOULD purge:

Purge your �following� list of any toxic thinspo, or pro ana/mia accounts that are incredibly detrimental to your health. Block any pro ana accounts you know of, so your chances of seeing thinspo, or ana tips, are decreased. You don�t deserve to be exposed to that kind of triggering content. 
If applicable, purge your own Tumblr account of things that could be triggering to yourself, or anyone else who may see it.
Purge your house of any scales, laxatives, diet pills, diuretics etc. They are bad for you, and are keeping you stuck, and you don�t deserve that. The hardest part is actually taking the big step of getting rid of them. Once they�re gone, it�s easier, and actually feels quite liberating.
Lastly, purge your life of any negativity. This includes people who are toxic and are making you unhappy. You deserve a positive, friendly environment and friends who make you feel good about yourself.
Remember: you deserve life, not to purge.
