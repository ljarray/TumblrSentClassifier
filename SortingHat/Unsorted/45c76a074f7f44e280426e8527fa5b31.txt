
Hi. I?ve had a shit day. I just had to help my mum put my nan in a nursing home. I had to chase my demented nan down the driveway and have her try to hit me. My mum was in tears.
And I come home to bullying on my body image shirts? Guys, there are styles that go up to 5XL. You just have to click reserve now, then you can select the size and quantity. 
Seriously, I?m trying to do something helpful for the body image movement, I?m trying to help people. And I get told to fuck off. 
Please, if you?re worried about the sizes, click reserve now, then select your desired design and size. I?m doing what I can with what is provided. Teespring offer better sizes than a lot of crowd funding shirt sites.

Please stop being nasty to me. I?m only trying to help.
