
Ok PSA: please don?t ever make fun of bigger people who are out exercising okay and don?t laugh and encourage your kids/friends if they happen to do it. They are fucking trying. They know they aren?t fit and now they are doing something about it. A few weeks ago I was walking and a group of like 3 or 4 kids were biking past me, and when they passed they were looking back at me and laughing and saying mean things and it honestly has stopped me from going out. I set my alarm for 6 am, thinking they would still be sleeping and I could go out in peace, but when it went off in the morning, I kept thinking about the scenario and I just haven?t exercised since. Kinda silly of me, because fuck them right? but still words do hurt okay and I?m self conscious and now embarrassed.
