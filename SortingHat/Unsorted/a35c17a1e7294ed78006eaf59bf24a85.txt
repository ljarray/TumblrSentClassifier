
I?m going to tell you why GOT7?s ?Just Right? Video is perfect
there are a lot of reasons but here are just a few of them

they?re a popular kpop boy group addressing body image issues
because they?re a popular kpop boy group they have some if not a lot of influence over their audience
we all know that korea and asia in general has a pressure to be skinny and pretty and they basically just broke that wall down saying that you are perfect the way you are
being a boy band they know they have a lot of female fans, most of which are younger
which is why they used a younger girl (age 12-14) in their videos because let?s be honest this is the age where body image issues start to pop up
instead of singing about love they decide to address a major issue that basically ruins lives in asia, which is a stepping stone in itself
they made their music video in a cute and adorable way not only to attract the correct audience but also make them go back and watch it again, getting  the message across effeciently and effectively
just thank god for got7 this is really wonderful to see thank you
