
Just put on my first incontinence pad.
And it?s so much thicker than I expected and I just feel like I?m wearing a diaper. Ive not worn pads for years as I used menstrual cups but it seems that incontinence ones are way thicker anyway. It?s just not helping my self esteem much. I wish #incontinencepride was a thing. I want confident, self assured people who leak and feel okay about it to look up to.

Cause I?m 22 and everything I see in the media or social media about people my age is everything I?m not. The people I can actually identify with? 60+ year old women.
