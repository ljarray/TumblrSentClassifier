
What is love?
With the weekends with the hunk having been stolen away recently due to Singapore�s National Day Parade (NDP) and their need for National Service Army men helpers, I�ve been facing the dilemma of what�s love, communication and distance. 

I wont� deny that it�s hard, not being able to see the person you love when you want, your meetings limited to a rushed lunch or a squeezed in late-night movie, before zooming back home for a short 5-hour sleep and having to get up at the crack of dawn for NDP duty. Between schooling, working, lesson consultations, the gym and balancing my relationship - This quote couldn�t have popped up on my browser at  better time. 


Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of eternal passion. That is just being �in love� which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Those that truly love, have roots that grow towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms have fallen from their branches, they find that they are one tree and not two.
