
Okay, I?m lit about that Fox News discussion on overweight kids having confident in themselves. 

Quotes like, ?What do we do with confident fat kids?? and ?Feeling good about themselves when they shouldn?t.? 

It is unrealistic to think everyone is fit for a specific body type. Kids are feeling good about themselves, young girls COMFORTABLE in their bodies, and they want to destroy that for?what exactly? So that these kids can struggle to love themselves and the body they are in for the rest of their life? Being pressured to lose weight doesn?t solve health issues, it creates them- SELF WORTH ISN?T JUST FOR SKINNY PEOPLE. Not to mention thin people can also be unhealthy! This isn?t a stigma that only applies to people with a little bit of fat on their bodies. Of course it?s important to stay healthy, but if you think being healthy means fitting society?s standards of having a ?perfect? body- you?re way off. Let these kids feel good about themselves and build up the confidence they deserve so people like the assholes on Fox News will never be able to make these kids feel bad for not looking like THEY think they should.
