
Broccoli mushroom garlic butter quinoa
1 tbsp evoo
1-2 tbsp tamari
Pinch of black pepper
1-2 tsp garlic powder
2-3 cups sliced portobello mushrooms
2-3 cups broccoli, washed and trimmed
1 cup of quinoa
2 cups of filtered water or vegetable broth
� cup grated Parmesan (optional)
2 tbsp butter


1. Heat olive oil on high heat in a large skillet, when oil is heated, add sliced mushrooms and broccoli ; cook on medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring with spatula. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic and tamari, use less or more depending on how your want the flavor (I just sprinkle it on); saute for 5 more minutes.

2. Cook quinoa; in a saucepan place quinoa in water and bring to a boil, once boiling reduce heat to medium low and cover with lid tightly, let simmer for about 15 minutes or until quinoa is fluffy. Set aside.

3. Once veggies are done, add quinoa and reduce heat to low or take off heat, sprinkle a little more garlic and tamari on, add butter and parmesan and stir until well mixed. Serve warm.

Ps- This dish can be made paleo if you exclude the parmesan, for vegetarians it�s necessary to eat ancient grains like quinoa as a source of protein.
