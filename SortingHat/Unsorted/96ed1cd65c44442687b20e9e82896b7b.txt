
FatAttack2015
I know I�m almost late (it�s 11:57 here) but reading thru #fatattack2015 has been great!

I have always been a chunk. Bigger and taller than the other kids all thru school. And made fun of constantly for it. I would always try to �hide� away from ppl, stay in the back of classes, shrink down in chairs and slouch to make myself appear to be smaller.

I have always been scared. Scared to be made fun of, to be hurt, to be in the spotlight. My dad still says that I�m 'as big as a bear but as timid as a rabbit�. I don�t show emotion, I can hide whatever I�m feeling, but fear and anxiety tear me up inside. I try to crack a fat joke on myself, so that ppl laugh 'with me� rather than just at me.

My papaw says that 'good christian men don�t drink/cuss/hit when we are sad or angry�we eat�. And that has been my coping mechanism. I have snuck food as long as I can remember. My earliest is hiding and eating in the kitchen cabinet at my grandma�s around 4-5. I could have asked for food but was too scared, so I snuck it and ate inside the cabinet.

At 32, food is still my go to. Although I have done fairly well dropping almost 40lbs this year, I still crave food when any emotion hits. And I crave binge worthy proportions, an example from this last week: I don�t want a fudge round�I want a BOX of fudge rounds!

It took 32 years for me to start to realize that I�m a pretty good guy. I might not be the best looking or most muscular or have a great head of hair�.but I try to be a great dad, a good husband, a caring medical professional, a loving pastor.

And while I still struggle with fear and food, and sometimes wonder if I always will, I know that I am more than a number on a scale. More than a few too many X�s on a tshirt. And I hope that some day fat shaming will be a thing of the past, and us chunky kids will be able to live without fear
