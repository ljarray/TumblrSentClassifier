I?m fat. okay I know it. I don?t need people to tell me I?m not, I don?t need my skinny friends going ?noooo you?re not you?re just curvy? or ?you?re not fat you just have a big built? and especially the whole ?you?re not fat? argument after they complain about their own body to me when I?m like twice their size. I don?t need to hear it. I don?t need to hear any of it. because you?re seriously doing the opposite of helping and you?re doing the opposite of making me feel better. I struggle with my weight and on top of that I struggle with my thin friends saying they?re fat and I struggle to keep sane when people try to be polite by saying I?m that I?m not fat because they feel the need to be nice. id honestly prefer it if people would just stop. I don?t want you to lie, I also don?t want you telling reminding me I?m fat, I?d rather just have none of it. 

and it?s sad because I try. I try to lose weight I try to control my diet but nothing works and people still tell me if I feel fat I should try to exercise and diet. you don?t get that it?s not that easy for everyone to lose weight because you?ve never had that problem. you don?t know fat if you aren?t fat. you don?t know how it?s like to want to cry in fitting rooms, to have society and the media shun people like you because you?re not the ideal size, to not want to leave the house because you don?t want people to see you, and to dread swimsuit season. don?t pretend you know how hard it when you?re literally like a hundred and ten pounds because I don?t. need. to. hear. it. I don?t need to hear thin and averaged sized people tell me their fat and afterwards be the same people that try to reassure me and comfort me because all of it- 

 all of it is clearly bullshit 

 and it definitely doesn?t make me feel better
