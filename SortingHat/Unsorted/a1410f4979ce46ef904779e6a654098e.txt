
Feel free to ignore me
But I wish we saw more positivity for people with acne, especially people like me who ?should? have outgrown it by now. It?s one of my biggest insecurities and I?ve tried everything to fix it and it would be nice to be told that it?s okay and doesn?t make me repulsive once in a while
