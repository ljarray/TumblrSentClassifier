
Shakes just aren't for me!
Well, after two weeks or so on the �Slim Fast � diet, I have decided it is most certainly not for me! I do just fine replacing two meals a day with shakes instead, but I find by supper I am just ravenous. I crave carbs like crank, and find it ridiculous what I was enduring! In all probability, I was doing something wrong� Oh well!

Something I can take away from the diet is the fact that chocolate milk (almond or soy, preferred) satisfies my cravings for chocolate in any form! No more cravings!! I also mix my Whey Protein shakes with a chocolate flavored whey. It is such a treat!

In lieu of my recent failure with shakes, I�ve decided to turn to what so many, MANY people swear by� calorie counting. I have my book for when apps are unavailable! There�s no time like the present!!
