But today�s about celebrating our fat! This body has carried me through twenty years. This body has let me do crafts, write, run, lift, dance, study, and love. This body is good at being a body despite me being cruel to it more than it deserves. This is my body, big and beautiful and fat. This month I�m not going to weigh this body. I�m not going to measure this body. Instead, I�m going to flex this body. Work out this body. Feed this body the nutritious food it deserves. It�s a long, steep hill to climb, but one day I�m going to love this body the way it should have always been loved. No matter what, it�s a beautiful and organic thing. And remember: if birds and cats are still cute when they�re chubby, why aren�t we? Love you guys.
