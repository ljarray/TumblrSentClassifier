
What I Eat in a Day - July 16
So for breakfast today I had vanilla greek yogurt with a kiwi, pear, 1 tbsp of slivered almonds and some cinnamon.

For a snack I ate a green apple, and then later some yellow pepper.

For lunch I had 2 fried eggs; fried in a slice of yellow pepper, with some swiss cheese (1 slice) and tomato (2 slices) on it. I used � tbsp of coconut oil to cook it.

For a snack I had some frozen red grapes, and later, 1 slice of whole grain toast with some goat cheese (approx. 2 tbsp). 

For dinner, I basically had a second breakfast! I had some oatmeal (� cup rolled oats, 2/3 cup unsweetened almond milk, and 1/3 cup water - cause I ran out of almond milk), with vanilla greek yogurt and � cup of frozen mixed berries. I also added some cinnamon for flavour! 

And, because my throat is really sore, for a snack I had a homemade ice pop using chamomile tea, honey, ginger and lemon. 

And that is what I ate today!
