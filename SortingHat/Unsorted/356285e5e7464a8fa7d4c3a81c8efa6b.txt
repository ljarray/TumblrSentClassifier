
We Bare Bears for the win
seriously this show is SO fucking enjoyable!!!! and it�s one of those perfect makeups of good for kids and adults at the same time. 

The levels of diversity are great, the background characters even included someone wearing a hijab.

Panda has a peanut allergy and it introduces kids to epi-pens, i�ve literally NEVER seen that in a show, and it�s placed in the show in a soft enough way that it�s not creepy and uncomfortable, but it tells people what it is and what can be done about it.

Other than that, the show just has a lot of heart and a lot of humor. definitely suggest catching this show
