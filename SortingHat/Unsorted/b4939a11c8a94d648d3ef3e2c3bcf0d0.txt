
The biggest fight with myself
Responding to thoughts of restricting my diet when I want to lose weight. I eat fine, if not enough as it is. I am eating pretty healthy now if not eating too much peanut butter. If I want to be healthier I need to head back to the gym.

I love lifting. I should be doing it.

Honestly fitnika, your words are being voiced in my head. I love lifting weights, so there?s no excuse why I shouldn?t have time to do it. People like you, thefitally, aubernutter, bananasandkale, crossfit-cupcake, and quite a few others that I can?t remember off the top of my head or I follow on IG, who chose to be healthy because they prefer that lifestyle not because of a goal ?look?, are wonderful role models and I consistently receive good advice they share so freely.

TL;DR - If I am shaming my body, I should be doing something about it instead of spiraling.
