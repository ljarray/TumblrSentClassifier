#operationgethealthy is once again under way! I did so good for a week and then fucked it up with a cheat day that then turned into a cheat week. But that�s ok! Just gotta get back in the saddle. 
I�ve completed a 3 hour meal prep for the week and I�m pretty damn proud of myself. Things I made:

-steamed �forbidden� black rice: much more nutrients than other rice and more antioxidants 
-grilled chicken marinated in blue moon, onions, garlic and spices
-roasted butternut squash
-poached asparagus in veggie stock, wine and red pepper flakes
-saut�ed spinach and kale
-saut�ed mushrooms

All boxed up in 5 different containers for each work day. Top that shit off with avocado, chia seeds, nutritional yeast and red chili paste and I�m GOLDEN.

Who says clean eating has to be boring?
