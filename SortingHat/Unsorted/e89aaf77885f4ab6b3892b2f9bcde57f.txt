
I wish people didn?t associate or consider the word fat as a bad thing. Yes I?m fat but that does not in anyway make me less of a person or unhealthy. All it means is that I love food, maybe a little more than I should. But I?m a chef, we are told to taste everything we make, taste everything we can. It?s also hard for me to lose weight due to my meds. So I?ll stay fat but healthy and I wish more people understood that. Life is too short to worry about a few extra pounds.
