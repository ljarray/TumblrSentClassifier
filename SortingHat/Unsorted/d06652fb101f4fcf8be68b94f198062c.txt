The other day, my friend asked me, �why are you always wearing a tank? Like we get it. You have muscles.� To that I responded, �Damn right I have muscles. I work my ass off so I�m gonna show it off.�

To elaborate more and explain to the non-lifters out there. There are a few reasons why we, big guys, wear tanks often.

1. If we are gonna spend years working out like beasts and denying ourselves pizza and ice cream then we are gonna show off the result of that. It�s the same as people showing off their wealth, fashion, intelligence�etc.

2. We are HOT AS FUCK. And I don�t mean that in a sexy, attractive way. I LITERALLY mean we are HOT. Working out and lifting heavy does increase core body temperature. It also revs up the metabolism for several hours after a workout. So we are running hot all the time as a result. And since walking around naked in public is not really socially acceptable, we compromise for as little clothing as possible.

3. It just feels good. And quite honestly, the larger we get, it�s pretty much the only thing that fits comfortably and isn�t tight in certain areas. Tight clothes are nice for showing off, but it�s not really comfortable, especially if we have enough body fat that when we sit, the tightness highlights our belly fat.
