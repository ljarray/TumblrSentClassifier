
Here we go AGAIN..
Life lately has been unstructured, crazy and busy. Eating and work out habits haven?t been the best. Today I wrote out short term and long term goals about weight goals and changing habits for the better. The year is halfway over and I have meet one of the 2 major goals I set for myself in January.

I stopped weighing myself because I am not happy with the numbers I keep seeing on the scale. I have never had ill feelings towards my body in my life. I HAVE to hold myself to a higher standard.

I just bought a Pure Barre package. So my goal is to go 3-4x a week. I really enjoy that I get a total body workout. What I need to incorporate is cardio.

2 years ago I ran 4 or 5 half marathons in a 15 month span. Now I can barely run a mile. I would like to run multiple ones this fall. But that means I gotta get over whatever mental block toward running I currently have.

So I am ending my pity party. If I am unhappy with my body it is MY JOB to fix it. I WILL fix it. I want it so bad.

Self control, discipline and determination. That?s what it will take. I possess all of these skills. Months from now I want to be filled with pride and happy to share my progress.

I am making it official. Tomorrow is day 1. If I can reach and exceed goals in my professional life, I can do it on a personal level. This time I am not going to become fixated on a number. I will focus on being happy and healthy.
