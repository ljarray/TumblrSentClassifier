
Amazing workout day today!
I put in my all and I felt the burn, and now I feel energized today! Between 40 minutes of cardio and 20 minutes of lifting, I know Iï¿½m gonna be sore later. Only doing this for a couple weeks now, and I have a long way to go. But I know with the right motivation and endurance, I can do most anything!! Time to run some errands and enjoy the beautiful day!
