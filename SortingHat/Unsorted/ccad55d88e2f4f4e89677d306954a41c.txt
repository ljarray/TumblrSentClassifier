
C: I didn?t notice this until I saw it mentioned on this blog and since then I?ve been looking more into it, but I think its true: Black tumblr definitely has a preferred aesthetic and this is especially true for plus size black women. If I see a picture of a plus size black woman with a lot of notes, her makeup and hair are on point and there is never a blemish on her skin. Even on those blogs that are for plus sized black women, they are always super feminine. Yall know for a fact you aint gonna see a plus size black woman wearing sweats and with a clean face with a lot of notes. It seems that plus size black women are only beautiful when her face is beat and  she is wearing sexy underwear or a bathing suit.
