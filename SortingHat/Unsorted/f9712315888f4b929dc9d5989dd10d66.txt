
I?m all about body positivity. I love the brands that decide to create things for plus size women and use them in their ads. However one thing I?ve noticed through the years is that everyone goes to the extremes. Models are incredibly skinny and the body positive movement uses girls that are much larger. I would like to see a company use girls closer to the medium. Size 6 girls or size 8 girls that are maybe shorter than what a model would be which is also something I?ve noticed. Bring in those girls that don?t fit into either. Bring in the girls that are told they are to fat to be one but aren?t big enough to be the other. Bring in the girls that some look at and envy while others look at and call fat. Bring in the girls that wear petite sizes. Bring in the girls who are to chubby for petite sizes to fit but are to short for the normal ones to look right. Bring in the girls who are to tall for normal clothes to fit. Bring in a medium. Bring in new body types. Small boobs big boobs medium boobs. Bring in Apple shaped pear shaped hourglass shaped. I love the body positive movement. Sometimes I just wish they would decide to include more people than the plus sized. Just because we aren?t plus sized doesn?t mean we are comfortable and that we fit into model land.
