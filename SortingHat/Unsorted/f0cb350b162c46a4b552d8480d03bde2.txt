
while I?m still complaining about representation, can I just bring up what it?s like to consume media while fat

fortunately for me, I?m white and a dude-type person, so at least there are more than like 2 actors who vaguely share my appearance

but the character archetypes available to me are still ?goofy jolly chef,? ?grotesquely overindulgent villain who symbolizes the Evils of Greed? or ?really funny, but only because he had to develop a great sense of humor because otherwise no one would like him?

I can pretend to aspire to the ?very slightly gone-to-seed middle-aged man who gets to be protagonist and has own character arc? but honestly that?s 60 pounds below my fictional character weight class

and at least I?m relatively masculine! when I was living as a girl the only tropes I could aspire to were ?funny sidekick in chick flick who is a great wing-woman but too undesirable to get her own heteronormatively prescribed boyfriend? or ?ugly woman who hates herself (and maybe finally gets redemption if she goes on Weight Watchers and mystically becomes thin without any loose skin or lasting side effects)?

and if you?re andro it?s like??????.sorry. if you?re not white/thin/flat chested/narrow-hipped as David Bowie/Ruby Rose/Tilda Swinton/Andreja Pejic then there?s literally nothing for you
