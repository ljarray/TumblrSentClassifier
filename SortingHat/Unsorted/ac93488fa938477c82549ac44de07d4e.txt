I said no to disordered thoughts last night in large part, because I didn�t want to disappoint you or myself. I wanted to be stronger than my disorder, and last night I was. It is possible to turn a bad moment into a good one. It is possible to say no to the part of your brain that says you�re worthless, and instead learn to love yourself with all of your flaws and imperfections. I did that last night. And today I�m so happy ??
