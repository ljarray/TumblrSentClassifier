
Not just about Weight
Imagine my surprise as I recently read about Asian women and the amount of cosmetic surgery they were willing to go through.  As I looked through the pictures my main thoughts were ?But they are all so skinny?they have great bodies?they are so petite.?  See, here I thought if I lost weight my problems with my self and body would be somewhat relieved.  Maybe not gone, but somewhat relieved.  How could I know that then I might start questioning how my face looks? I guess there are more body image problems than I?ve acknowledged.
