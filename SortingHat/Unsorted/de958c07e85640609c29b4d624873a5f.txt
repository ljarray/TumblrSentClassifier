
I'm boycotting my mirror .
After yesterday I?m breaking up with my mirror, for a week. Analyzing my body for little changes everyday isn?t healthy. I?ve become addicted to it, I?m thinking about it right now.

I just need to stop worrying about this goal weight bullshit and relax. Although I did want to meet my GW for my 21st birthday and I hate the thought of disappointing myself. I need to make sure I stay mentally healthy.
