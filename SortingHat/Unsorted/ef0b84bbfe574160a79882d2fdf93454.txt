
Me and my body
So research says women usually see themselves 10-20 pounds heavier 
Body dysmorphia 
And im starting to see it more and more 
Its really disheartening 
I look at my body and I was happy but I havent been so much of late 
But i know Im continually losing weight or toning up

Hell I do derby for 9 hours a week and lately outside in the 90+ weather 
And eating a gluten free, healthier diet
But i see no more progress 
Hmp
