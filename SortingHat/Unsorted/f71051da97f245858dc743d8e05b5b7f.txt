
What I Eat in a Day - July 20
So for breakfast today I had some chia pudding (using 2 tbsp of chia seeds and � cup unsweetened almond milk - leave in the fridge overnight). I added a peach, a kiwi, and a green apple to this.

For a snack I had a cheese string.

For lunch I had a spinach pie (spanakopita) from my favourite greek restaurant.

For a snack I had a vegetable platter, with cucumber, broccoli and a carrot.

For dinner, I tried to have some butternut squash soup, but to be honest, I didn�t like it. I ended up having some tofu, half a corn on the cob and � cup of frozen raspberries instead. 

For a snack I had � tbsp of peanut butter and some vanilla greek yogurt with cinnamon!
