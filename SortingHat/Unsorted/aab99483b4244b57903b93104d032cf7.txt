Practice Self Love!


Something that I still struggle with every day is practicing acts of self love. I?ve learned over the years that I?m really good at giving love to other people, as well as receiving love from other people, but I still have yet to master the art of self-love. For the longest time, I viewed self love as a synonym for being conceded or selfish. It was engrained in my mind to always expect more of myself and to never accept mediocrity. I found that I was falling into these cycles of negative thought patterns, none of which included any self soothing or self encouragement. Even when it comes to losing weight, I see the numbers on the scale go down, I see the differences in the mirror, I hear the compliments from others, but I still have this mental block about cheering myself on and telling myself that I?m doing a good job. It just feels unnatural to me. The phrase ?self praise is no praise? comes to mind, something my mom loves to say. But lately I?ve really been trying to focus my attention on practicing self love and exploring what that means to me. 

The picture above shows my ?daily self love? mason jar. I wrote down as many acts of self love that I could think of on slips of paper, and every day I pull one and have to do it. Some of the acts include: 
-Take a bath
-Go for a walk
-Write down 10 things you like about yourself
-Give yourself a facial
-Paint your nails
-Do yoga
-Meditate
-Go get your eyebrows threaded
-Write a blog post
-Take a selfie
-Go volunteer at the animal shelter [something I would HIGHLY recommend doing for all you animal lovers out there!! I volunteer at NKLA and I absolutely love it.]
-Go to a new park you?ve never been to
-Read a book
-Get a pedicure
-Get a massage
-Go to the beach
-Go to the movie theater by yourself

I made sure NOT to make any of these self love acts be food-related. A realization I?ve come to in this whole lifestyle change/weight-loss journey is far too often I would eat for the wrong reasons. If I was having a bad day, my favorite junk food would make it better. If I was having a good day, why not make it better by eating at my favorite greasy restaurant as the cherry on top of a perfect day? It was really self-destructive and I?m trying my hardest to get myself out of those habits. 

I also made sure not to include other people on these slips of paper. The whole point of self love is to be self sufficient, and to be able to make yourself happy without relying on other people to provide you happiness. Not to say that there?s anything wrong with calling up an old friend to see how they?re doing! For me personally, I have a hard time being alone, so when I am, I tend to whip out my phone and start texting all my friends on the east coast because the idea of being by myself is scary. Weird, I know. But at least I?m aware of it and I?m making an honest effort to get better about it. 

The thing I like about the mason jar idea is that it forces you to actually practice these acts and solves the ?I?m bored I don?t know what to do with myself? problem. Do not under estimate the power of self love! As cheesy as it sounds, remember that you can?t love another person with your whole heart until you love yourself first. The more love you have for yourself, the more likely you are to keep all the extra weight off and live a healthy life. Even more, you will start to attract people and circumstances to you that support your well-being! [ holla at the law of attraction :) ]
