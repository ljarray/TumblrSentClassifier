
I?m craving sugar so much the past few days which leads to overeating and it?s annoying me because like I feel so fat??? Like I?m physically not putting any weight or fat on but mentally I feel huge and idk, it doesn?t feel good and I hope it goes away because I feel so gross because I was making so much progress with the exercise and now I feel like I?m throwing all of that away idk
