The #1 thing that is constantly sore on me from aerial is my fingers. The coaches and performers tell me this will fade, but itï¿½s a pain that tells me I accomplished something unique this week.

I ate a clean breakfast this morning. 2 scrambled eggs cooked in coconut oil with hot sauce and 1 cup of fresh greens, with a few raspberries as a reward. Feel good, not tired or hungry. Happily satisfied.
