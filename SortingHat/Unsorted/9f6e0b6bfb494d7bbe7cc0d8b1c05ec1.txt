If someone is wearing makeup in the pool, don?t deliberately splash them.
If someone has done their hair nicely, don?t mess it up.
If someone in a t-shirt has scars on their arms, don?t ask them about it.
If someone doesn?t want to get in the water, don?t push them.
If someone still wants to wear jeans, don?t laugh at them for it.
If someone has sweat patches, don?t point them out.
If someone?s chest is obviously prominent, don?t stare.
If you can see someone?s underwear/ binder, don?t comment on it. 
If someone is blatantly covering something up, don?t try to reveal it.

Not everyone can feel totally comfortable with the fact it?s Summer, don?t make them feel worse.
