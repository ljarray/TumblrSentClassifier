
Perfect
Spinning around, 

I looked at my bare body up and down in the leaning mirror,

 taking in every detail of my perfections and imperfections. 

 I�ve come a long way from being hideous, 

 but beauty has yet been reached in my eyes. 

 Still looking at myself in the reflection,

 I begin to run my blue hands from my flat chest,

 down to my jagged ribs,

 and lower to my pointed hip bones;

 all the way down to the canyon between my thighs. 

 Many people say this is enough, 

but I know I can be better, 

 I know I can be �perfect.�
