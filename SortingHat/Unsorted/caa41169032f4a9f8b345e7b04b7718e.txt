
Another good day in the world of being food-conscious
Ate all the things I packed for my work lunch/dinner. Had a few timbits that a patient�s parents brought in because heck I�m on my feet for 12hours and moderation is key (I sabotage myself if my eating is restrictive or if I stress about allotted calories/macros per day). 
Drank 2L of water.
Vitamins, check.
Good day.
