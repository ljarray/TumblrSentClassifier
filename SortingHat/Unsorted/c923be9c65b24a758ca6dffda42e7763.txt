
Low carb for lyfe
By far the most success I�ve felt has been by going to the gym everyday and eating a low carb/gluten free diet. I�ve been following a strict diet regimen, but it�s easy because low carb food is delish! My go to�s are turkey bacon (only 30 calories a piece), salad with yogurt dressing, unsalted nuts, oatmeal and green tea of course. Try the low carb life, it�s not too shabby.
