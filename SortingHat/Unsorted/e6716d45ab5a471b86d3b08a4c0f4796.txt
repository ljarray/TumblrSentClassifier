
Sometimes, I think about starving myself to make me feel skinnier , to make me feel better about myself but in reality I feel completely worse, and unattractive at all times, I remember about body image and loving yourself is important, but it?s so hard when in reality all people do is judge your body image..
So please be body positive and never think negative about yourself. Because it hurts and no one should feel that pain .
