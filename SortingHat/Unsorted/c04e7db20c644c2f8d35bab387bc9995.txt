
What we ate Wednesday.
I�m still on the road to slim, as you may know I don�t follow a crazy fad diet, slimming world or shake diets, it�s purely healthy eating, smaller portions, 1 dessert serving (instead 5) and exercise. 

If you�ve been following me for a while you�d have seen �dearlittlemamagetsfit� started and failed, well not this time. THIS TIME I�M GOING TO GET FIT.

I always said I�d do �what we ate� instead of �what I ate� as it I know some of you like seeing Lucas� food choices too.

Todays breakfast:


We both ate Porridge, half a banana and a handful of blueberries, with a teaspoon of organic honey for sweetness. YUM! I had my usual cup of coffee and glass of water and Lucas had a cup of full fat milk.

Todays Lunch:


Mine was pretty boring and not exciting to photograph in the slightest.
Nicole: I had a chicken, bacon and lettuce sandwich with brown bread and a pure orange juice.
Lucas: Lucas had Dairylea sandwiches (cut into cute little hearts) and a handful of raspberries and had a cup of water which he drinks with a straw now.

Todays Dinner:


This was so tasty and yummy!
Nicole had: Green Tortelloni with cheese & spinach Biona with a fresh carbonara sauce.
Lucas had: Green Tortelloni with cheese & spinach Biona with a Philadelphia dollop and some parsley.

For pudding � (remember, everyone can have a treat, in proportion)
Lucas had: fromage frais
Nicole had: Red velvet cake

Snacks:
Nicole had: Natural greek style yogurt with honey (yeo valley) and a handful of raspberries.
