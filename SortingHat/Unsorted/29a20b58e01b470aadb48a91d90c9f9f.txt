
Day 30: Oh my goodness
So my best friend convinced me to take a hot Pilates class with her.

And for those of you who donï¿½t know that is when you take a regular Pilates class but the temperature of the room is like 100 degrees.

And honestly. I felt great and like shit all at the same time! Like I felt like shit cause I was all sweaty and gross but I felt great cause it was a fantastic work out!

I suggest everyone take a class like that at least once because it was frisky an experience haha

Breakfast:
A peanut almond protein bar

Lunch: 
A Starbucks protein bistro box
A black iced tea

Snack: 
A strawberry banana smoothie

Dinner: 
A baked potato with sour cream and cheddar cheese

Dessert: 
Oolong tea with honey

Pilates: 60 minutes 
Steps:2,749

Hope everyone had a wonderful day!!!

Love, Jenna ??
