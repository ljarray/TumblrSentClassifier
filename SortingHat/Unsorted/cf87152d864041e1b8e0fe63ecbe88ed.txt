What�s stopping you from losing weight? FOOD. Why do you hate your fat body? Because of FOOD. Why are you always feeling sad and pathetic about yourself? Because of FOOD. Although it�s the basic nourishment for your physical body it can also be poison that rots your body, mind, and soul. Do not live to eat, eat to live and that means as little as possible in order to attain your dream body. Why are you stuck in your fat body when you can be skinny and beautiful? Why are you so addicted to food? Is it what fills your sadness or boredom? Let the pangs of hunger fill it instead. Food will always be there, but the best times of your life are spent away being fat. You don�t want to look back at photos and be disgusted about yourself, you want to look back and think �damn, I�m hot!� Even if your life sucks, even if you�re living in misery, at least you�ll go through it beautiful and skinny not fat and ugly.
