
It�s Tuesday and I am properly hydrated!

For the first time in about a week and a half. I�m also going to work out this afternoon (like, an actual proper cardio workout) for the first time in about two weeks, and I am absolutely probably going to die. I�d gotten a bit off-track with�everything, but in a way I think it�s been beneficial. Now that I know what it feels like to actually live within my calorie goals and doing regular work outs, I�m so much more aware of how different it feels when I�m not watching what I eat as much and letting myself be lazy for a while, and I really don�t like it. I�ve got so much less energy, but more nervous energy, and I feel more jammed up and foggy mentally and physically. I can actually feel myself getting weaker and my body falling back into its habits of not moving and not working and not being active and awake. So I�m pretty excited to get back into things.

Not that excited to die on this run today, but excited for all the rest of it.

I�ve got my physical coming up in a couple of weeks (on my birthday. Why did I do that to myself.) and I think I�m going to talk to my doctor about my anxiety and depression. I haven�t actually talked to a professional since college, but it�s getting to the point that I think I at least need some kind of advice or information. Handling it on my own is starting to take over a lot of my life and it�s starting to actively make it difficult for me to do the things I want and have to do, and if there�s better ways of living with it, I�d definitely like to hear about them.

Happy Tuesday, y�all. Remember to drink water, say hello to your pets, and text somebody you like today.
