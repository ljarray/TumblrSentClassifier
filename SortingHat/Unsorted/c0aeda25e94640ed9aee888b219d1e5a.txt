
My body is weird
I have a small head with crooked features: one eye bigger than the other, nose hooking off to the side, crooked teeth on only one side of my mouth. Red lips that give my health away.

I have broad, bony shoulders that won?t hold a purse strap, and are covered in big, amorphous freckles.

I have a strange, short torso with large hips, and a chest with a bloom of blue-green veins all across it.

I have too-long legs with knobby knees and an ankle with a mysterious bone spur. Muscular thighs and very thin calves. 

I have weird skin, that is technically ?olive? but is largely too pale to be considered such. 

My entire body feels translucent and many of my veins are easily visible. 

I don?t know if my body is that weird, or if having a body is just weird.
