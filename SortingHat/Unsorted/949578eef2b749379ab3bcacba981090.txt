
i'm back, guys, and this time I mean business
So my sister�s wedding is coming up - 2nd of October - and I�ve set that date as my goal to have lost atleast 15kg. It�s doable, for sure. I just need to fucking stick to it this time!

My weight has gone back up to 110kg, something I�m definitely not proud of but one thing I have learned about myself since the gain is what type of eater I am - I�m a constant craver. Now I�m aware of this I need to remember a few things. 1) Feeling peckish is not being hungry. 2) Eating breakfast actually does cancel out the wicked cravings that come on my first break at work. 3) Drinking a shit ton of water throughout the day will help me distinguish between hunger and cravings. 

Now comes the hard part.
