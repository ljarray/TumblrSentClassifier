
Losing weight is weird. Every time I pass a mirror it takes me a minute to realize I�m looking at my reflection. Even when I�m sitting, my legs don�t look like mine because they�re so much thinner. 
I�m actually getting cat called by men and women. I�ve adopted a new nickname, �sweet cheeks.�
Many girls would be offended by this, but I feel like hours of working out, eating right, and changing my life style has finally paid off. 
The best part is that my boyfriend looks at old pictures of me and tries to tell me I looked pretty no matter what size I am. I keep telling him I�m healthier and happier with my new lifestyle changes. He supports me all the way.
