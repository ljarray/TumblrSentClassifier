
�Getting Healthy is Hard�
For years I have made excuses. 

Eating healthy is hard.

Working out is hard. 

Finding time is hard.



Well, I am done.  Because do you know what is harder?  Waking up not loving my body.  Not feeling great about myself.  Feeling like shit every time I cheat.  Looking at the number on the scale.  

The next time I don�t do something healthy because it�s not easy, i need to remember I feel uneasy in my own skin.  And I need to do something about it.
