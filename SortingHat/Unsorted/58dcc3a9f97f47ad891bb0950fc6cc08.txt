
Whole30 day 11
Days 12-15: Boundless energy! Now give me a damn Twinkie.

Hurray! The slump is over! Your pants fit again! Your energy levels are better than normal � you�re downright Tigger the bouncing tiger! But something weird is happening. You�re dreaming. Not crazy nightmare or strange surrealist dreams, either. Incredibly normal and realistic dreams � about donuts. Or Twinkies. Or Snickers.* In your mind, sometimes you get caught and feel guilty. Sometimes you just brazenly eat the contraband. But then, the feelings start following you into the waking hours. Suddenly, you�re craving things you don�t even like. (For me, it�s Diet Coke and Twinkies, for Melissa Hartwig, it was fast-food cheeseburgers!) Your co-workers� heads transform into giant Girl Scout Cookies as you gaze on in disbelief. Seriously, you�ve almost hit the halfway mark, and now this?!

It happened! I dreamed the dream�

Last night I dreamed I had pasta with pesto sauce (I don�t even like pesto!). I told all my friends it was zucchini noodles and I felt so bad and dishonest! A bit off schedule but whatever.

Other than that so far so good! No cheating yet, but Lollapallooza is this weekend and I 100% will be drinking there. I had a weekend festival the last time I did this too and it really didn�t derail me.
