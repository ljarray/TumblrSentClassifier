Oh the grocery store, where some days you have it down to a science, and can get in and out the building like a ninja. Other days, you wonder how you spent two hours reading labels for almost every product you�d been curious about. It�s how I ended up with kefir in my cart one day, and now this probiotic superfood is part of my daily life. 

I�d always thought of kefir as a �drinkable yogurt,� and wasn�t exactly sure what the difference was between the two. I thought consistency was the only real difference, but I was way off base. Kefir has been through a fermenting process. After this 24 hour process, kefir now has 10 to 20 strains of probiotics [in kefir], which is three times what you would find in yogurt. 





Why should you care about probiotics? Simply put, probiotics help keep everything moving. When we eat clean, exercise, and hydrate our goal is to keep everything in balance and release the toxins. It�s why we love a good sweat during our workout, your body is detoxing, and you can feel it happening.

Our guts or digestive system also need to be taken care with the same thinking in mind. You think it�s just the kidneys processing toxins, but it�s everything starting from our mouth, all the way to our gall bladder. 75% of your immune system is housed in your digestive system, and with the help of kefier, you can help it work properly with it�s good bacterias and vitamins. 

Kefir is right up there with the other superfoods like kale, chia seeds, and blueberries for the multitude of health benefits you�ll receive. Drink it regularly and you�ll

    �    Boost your immunity

    �    Heal inflammatory bowel disease

    �    Build bone density

    �    Fight allergies

    �    Improve lactose digestion

    �    Kill candida

    �    Support detoxification

If you�re lactose intolerant or trying to reduce the amount of dairy you consume, don�t worry, through the fermentation process kefir loses much of it�s sugar or �lactose� as it�s more commonly known, and you end up with lactic acid instead. How?

Fermented foods go through a process of lactofermentation in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food creating lactic acid. This process preserves the food, and creates beneficial enzymes, b-vitamins, Omega-3 fatty acids, and various strains of probiotics. All the good stuff our body wants and needs.





People have been drinking kefir for centuries. Before refrigeration and all these modern conveniences, people did a lot of canning, preserving, and pickling. Without knowing it, people created superfoods, and have been reaping the benefits for centuries. 

Its unique name comes from the Turkish word �keif�, which means �good feeling.� Maybe because tryptophan, an amino acid, is also found in kefir, which we all know is found in turkey. It�s what puts you in the �let�s sit on the couch� and lounge mode. Now you can have the same feeling of relaxation without eating a monster holiday meal.

Kefir is a great way to get extra protein in your diet without extra calories. A single serving of plain, non-fat kefir has less than 100 calories, but provides 10.5 grams of protein, which can help you feel fuller without extra fat. Great for late night when you�re craving a snack or some ice cream. Why not add this healthy alternative into your diet? Just watch out for added calories and sugar if you purchase flavored kefir.

With the benefits of kefir becoming more well, there are so many different brands and varieties of kefir available. You can choose from cow, goat, coconut or water base, and if you�re not a fan of the plain flavored tart taste. You have anything from pomegranate, mangos, or peaches blended into you kefir.
