
Beginner�s Guide to Working Out

You finally did it, you made your way over to your local gym/or school�s rec center. The front desk people seem really nice. Maybe they helped you register or told you about the available amenities. Finally, you make your way over to the locker room to leave your things safely hidden. 

Then, you leave the locker room. And there�s all these people! All these fitness minded people! and machines! and racks! and contraption things! 

It�s okay, just breathe. They all started somewhere, and you�ll learn how to use those things too. 

I, once too, had to go through the awkward first couple days [weeks] of joining a gym. Maybe you haven�t gone through all that awkward first day stuff I mentioned above yet and you just want to know how the gym works. While I am by no means, an authority on all things fitness related, I have made significant enough process in my first few months, to help other beginners who may be feeling overwhelmed.

Find a gym that works for you!

Some of us college students are #blessed and have a free rec center to go to, but what about when that�s not an option? Gyms can be pricey, but if you search well enough, you can find one that�s affordable and has everything you need. Many gyms offer a free trial period. 24 Hour Fitness has a 3 days trial, and after completing a survey they emailed me months later, I got a whole month free. Texas Family Fitness also offers a free month. I haven�t had to pay for a gym all summer! Also, many cities and towns have their own rec center and membership is usually cheap. Check Groupon too.  Ask around and look for free offers. 

Wear comfortable clothing and shoes.

There�s always that one guy that walks in wearing cargo shorts and then you never see him again. Don�t be that guy. Or girl. Those jeans may look cute, but they�re not going to feel so good when you�re trying to do squats. And trust me, gym clothes can be cheap and affordable. If you need some ideas, try TJmaxx, Ross, Old Navy, Target, and H&M. The shoes shouldn�t be too much either. I like my Brooks, but they�re really only good for running/walking.  A simple pair of Nikes works fine.

 Make a plan!

Trust me, when I say that things will be much better off if you have a plan. Do your research. I once had a friend who wanted to have my brother make a plan for him. #No. That�s lazy. You know your body and you know what results you want. Don�t rely on other people because other people aren�t always going to be there. Use google. I also like bodybuilding.com. Pinterest is great too. However, if you have someone who really does want to show you the ropes, take the help. Just learn how to be a self-starter too.

Try something unexpected

I�m going to call out women on this for a second: TREADMILL? Elliptical?Really? I have nothing against cardio, in fact I think it�s necessary for all around good health. I run a bit myself. But women seem to think that if they even look at a weight, they�re going to turn into Mr. Olympia. Don�t think the weight room is just for men. Don�t say that you just want to be �toned�. You know how to get �toned�? The same way you build muscle. Keep on doing that cardio if you�re trying to slim down, it�s still good for you. You know what you like to do. But don�t let fear keep you from trying something new. Don�t be intimidated by all the people who look like they know what they�re doing. They�re usually nice individuals, who were once in your shoes too. 

Come prepared!

Nothing I wear has pockets so I usually just bring a small backpack and put it in a locker. My usual list: phone, headphone, arm band (to hold my phone), water bottle (so important), wallet, extra ponytail holder, and lock for the locker. Locks are pretty cheap at Walmart. I recommend them for sure. 

Eat Well.

I�m so bad at this. I cut back a lot on Starbucks and junk, but I still indulge fairly often. I don�t mean this in a �lose weight� type of way, but the only way you�ll see results is if you have good nutrition, or you�re doing it all for nothing. I feel even more crappy during my workout when I haven�t been eating right. Add some color to your diet with fruits and veggies. Get more protein. Eat lean meats. If you�re trying to put on size, you still should eat healthy, but in larger quantities. I think this also falls under the research category. Just remember good diet = good workout. 


As you can probably tell, I�m a beginner too. But I hope this helps and that I maybe answered a question or two. This was definitely more focused on strength training. Fitness is fun, and I love the way I feel from it! If it ever gets boring or you just feel really down on yourself, then find something you enjoy, as long it gets you moving.
