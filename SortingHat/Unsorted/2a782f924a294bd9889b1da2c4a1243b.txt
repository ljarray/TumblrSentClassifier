Day 16: Name something your partner dislikes about themselves but you love!

Cat: Okay, guys, I?m not going to lie to you: This prompt really stumped Richard and I! We actually had no idea how to answer this one? I guess I?ll just say this: Richard really is one of the most confident people I know, and I think it?s because he had to overcome a lot of adversity at a really young age. We both have that in common. While it hit me hard in my teenage years, especially when it came to body image issues, Richard went the other way. After overcoming everything, he took all that negativity and transformed it into positivity. It wasn?t overnight, and he hit some hard times. But at the end of it all, he became the strong, confident person he is today. So, because of that, I think there?s very little room in Richard?s mind to hate or dislike things about himself. And I love him for that. :)
