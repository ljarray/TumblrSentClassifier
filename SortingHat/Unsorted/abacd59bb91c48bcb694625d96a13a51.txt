
Believe it or not, there?s a way to compliment actors? current appearances (especially weight related) without shading/dissing/making fun of what they used to look like. Backhanded compliments like that are not actually cute or supportive. You don?t know anything about them. They could struggle/have struggled with eating disorders or general poor body image or have a thryoid problem, whatever. And maybe none of is true but it?s still rude either way. At the end of the day though, we just don?t know anything about these people. So please try to be considerate.
