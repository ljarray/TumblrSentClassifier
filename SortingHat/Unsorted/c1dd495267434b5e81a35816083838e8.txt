
Announcement #2
Okay, so I realise I haven�t been updating my What I Eat in a Day posts, but I�ve had to really switch things up in the last couple of days, so sorry about that! Anyways, as I mentioned before, I�m now off dairy and I�ve also started looking for substitutes for wheat cause that upsets my stomach� I found some great buckwheat noodles (despite the name, buckwheat isn�t actually a wheat ahahah) and I just tried those (yum!).

Anyway, so I�ll be restarting the What I Eat in a Day posts today, with a few little tweaks here and there, and I might mention my exercise for that day, too, but I�m not sure yet. Sorry for the inconvenience!
