
Yes it?s okay to be against fat shaming

But don?t skinny shame in the process

Yes it?s okay to be against wearing make up

But don?t be mean to the people who do

Yes it?s okay to not like to be dressed up

But do not shame people who do

It?s okay to have an opinion 

But don?t be rude about it
