While you sit their and judge how skinny Barbie is, you don�t realize monster high�s (another Mattel product.) Dolls literally look anorexic. Barbie has thick legs nice general sized boobs and nice oval head, which I personally think are appropriate (Do you think your child would play with a boring old human? It�s fantasy!!!!!!! She�s their to represent personality.) But with monster high dolls their arms, legs, and waist are so skinny the cheek bones so defined boobs so small, they look so very anorexic, Barbie actually looks healthy. So leave Barbie alone and look at these Dolls from monster high. No monster would be so skinny. (But I do like to say that they are great role models to being a great, respectful open minded friendly person.)
But this is my opinion, so don�t get worked up.
