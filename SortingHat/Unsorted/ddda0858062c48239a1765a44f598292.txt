
Eating Disorders.. Caused By The Media?
I think it�s actually quite misleading when people say that eating disorders are caused by seeing skinny girls in video games / fashion magazines etc. It�s a mental disorder caused by complex psychological & biological factors. There is a big difference between having an ED & just hating your appearance (both are bad, but different). It may be a contributing factor for some people, and we definitely need a greater variety of appearances (body type, age, ethnicity etc) represented in media, but to constantly spread this narrative is not very helpful as it prevents true understanding of those that need help.
