
Things that do not define you:
Cellulite, stretch marks, scars, loose skin, wrinkles, body hair, skin color, eye color, hair color, type of hair, fullness of your lips, butt size, boob size, waist size, any body size, crooked teeth, yellow teeth, body odor, excessive sweating, eczema, acne, etc. 

None of those things explain who you are as a person.
None of those things are anything to be ashamed of either. 
Some people have different genetics. 
You have acne? Cool, whatever. You have big boobs? Cool, whatever.
People need to get over what everyone else has and what they?re lacking.
Everyone is insecure over something. And that?s where the real issue lies.
