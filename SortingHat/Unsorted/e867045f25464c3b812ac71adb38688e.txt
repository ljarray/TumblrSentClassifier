
The start.
I don�t care if no one reads this. I�m not trying to be an inspiration I�m just trying to get myself back to a place where I can say �fuck yeah that�s me!� 
Why I�m doing this? Yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of four years. We are on a �break� and you know what? I fucking love him and want the best for him but in that relationship I was putting him first over everyone and everything including myself. And fuck it. It�s time for me to come first. No more pizza. No more fizzy. Time to cut down them carbs. Time to run/puff up the plentiful hills that surround my house. And in failing that why can�t I do a 20 minute work out inside when no one is looking? I�m extremely conscious of my weight and the way I look so I guess it�s time to look hot again. And to keep at it in a relationship. No to fall into comfort mode again. I will never hit 99kgs again. Ever.
