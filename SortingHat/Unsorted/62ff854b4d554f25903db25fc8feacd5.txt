
About veganism
When I was 10 I decided I would be a vegetarian. For a year or so before that I had a few failed attempts at cutting meat out of my diet, but I remember the exact moment I decided, for good, to be a vegetarian.

I was eating string beans from a Tupperware container that my mother had microwaved for me just before my father came to pick us up for the weekend. I looked down and thought, �well this stuff is delicious so I can do this.�

And that was it.

Then I learned that there are much worse things you can do to an animal than kill it, and we won�t discuss that here, but it motivated me to stop eating eggs, dairy or any other animal products. So when I was 15 I went completely vegan.

I gained almost 20 pounds in the first few weeks, I kid you not, because I wasn�t educated enough. I didn�t know about how protein makes you feel full, or about carbs. I was a junk food vegan, and I would have plain potato chips as full meals some nights. I was always starving, and sickeningly full at the same time. When I started to eat cheese and eggs again, I lost the weight and felt a lot better.

But veganism doesn�t have to be that way.

In fact, it can be a wonderfully healthy lifestyle.

I think I�m going to gradually transition back to being a vegan, as much as I�m going to miss ice cream and cheese, but it will probably be a better choice. Not just for me, or just for animals, but a better environmental choice as well.

This is going to be a lot of cooking, I can already tell�
