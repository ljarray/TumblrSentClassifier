
My Goal for this Week
Reach 217 lbs.

Last week I was hovering around 219. I believe that with some good cardio, clean eating, and plenty of water I can see myself hit 217's.

Some things I am using to make this realistic:

Chicken breast for lunch in various ways. Today I am eating it on gluten free bread. Tomorrow I might have a salad. The next day I might just eat it with some mustard.
veggies, veggies, veggies! For this, I have planned my dinner strategically including spaghetti squash spaghetti, asparagus with steak, and fajitas
21 Day Fix workouts er� day! Plus cardio from walking Charlie and running at the dog park
Woot! Pumped for the week. I feel adequately prepared and ready for the day! I�m also doing a long hike on Saturday (from around 730am to around 1pm) which will help with burning those calories!
