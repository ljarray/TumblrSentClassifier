
I cannot begin to understand these people who think they have a ?body positive? attitude by supporting people who are overweight and unhealthy. Even if you eat well, you still need to be exercising. And no skinny does not equal healthy either because plenty of skinny people have a high metabolism and eat like shit. Don?t try be ?body positive? by posting pics of overweight people to support them, do the right thing and encourage a healthy lifestyle. No way in hell am I encouraging diabetes, high cholesterol and digging yourselves an early grave.
