
I don't want to be me
I don�t like myself
I hate myself
Hate might be a deep word
But is the true feeling I have about myself
I hate my body
Hair
Face
Face features
My fat tummy, lag, arms, breasts, face, neck, back, chin, everything
My fingers
My nose
My eyes
My lips
My voice
My feet
My accent
I hurt hate myself and nobody can change that
Nothing that anyone ever says is going to change the fact that I hate myself and I always will
I just wish I have a huge paper bag to cover my hole self
I don�t want to be fat anymore
I just hate it
I don�t want to be described as the fattest, or the the fat or fatter girl in the group
I just wish I could be the skinny, thin, and slim girl
Yes
That sounds nice
Skinny girl is perfect
Skinny is perfection
I just wish I was skinny
I�m crying right now because I want to be skinny
I wish my parents didn�t force me to eat
They hate me they make me eat and then tell me I�m fat
I don�t want to eat nobody gets it
I want to be skinny not fat
I don�t want food
I don�t care if it�s not healthy I have to loose weight
At least the 17 kg I want to loose
Just that nothing else
I want to fasten without having people asking me why I�m not eating
I can�t eat 
Food is poison
Poison leaves fat behind
It stays in my body
And the mirror attacks me with loud judging voices
