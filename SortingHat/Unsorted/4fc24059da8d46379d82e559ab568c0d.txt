An Open Letter to Oprah about Crop Tops and Body Positivity



This is a letter I wrote to Oprah Magazine in response to a call for reader input in the August 2015 issue. It is in response to the totally banal and fatphobic response to a reader question in O Magazine that folks should wear crop tops ?If (and only if) they have flat stomachs.? I generally skim or skip the style and beauty content in O Magazine every month because it?s written towards folks?
