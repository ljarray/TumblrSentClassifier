
ive been incredibly positive about my body image lately and i think thats great, real confidence booster
like i have lost a lot of weight in first year of uni, i fit back into a bunch of my old clothes,  like ive practically went from wearing large to small and went down 2 waist measurements, and when i look in the mirror i just feel a hell of a lot better about myself, i?m a lot more trim and toned and like, its fucking awesome and ive never really felt like this before?

i have  like really mild pectus carinatum which means my sternum kinda sticks out a  teeny bit and is bony, and its always been a bit of an embarrasing thing for me, but because im looking better now its not so noticeable and it just looks like my chest sticks out a bit, which in turn isnt really a bad thing especially when wearing shirts

and my keratosis pliaris seems to be fading and getting a lot less noticeable on my arms and legs, and that is FUCKING AMAZING ive had that shit since i was 12 and its the most embarrasing demoralizing thing to have a skin ailment, like people used to notice it and point it out and it used to depress me to all hell, SO IM SO STOKED ABOUT THAT YOU DONT EVEN KNOW. its not entirely gone but its practically un noticable and its fuggin ace men

its fucked me up so bad that i basically never ever wear anything that doesnt cover the tops of my arms, and i try to steer clear of shorts as much as possible, even when its hot, so if i can stop doing that that would be FUCKING GREAT

so yeah, feeling good
