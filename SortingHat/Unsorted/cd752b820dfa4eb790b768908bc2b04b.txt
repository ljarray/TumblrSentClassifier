
if you bring up my weight to me please note that it often makes me very uncomfortable and i don?t like being asked things like ?why aren?t/are you eating??? ?what are you eating nowadays???? and PLEASE don?t speak on my behalf when it comes to my size and self image or things of that nature. i understand you may think what you?re doing is nice or helpful but it more often than not comes across patronizing and rude and makes me self conscious and makes me focus on my body image.
