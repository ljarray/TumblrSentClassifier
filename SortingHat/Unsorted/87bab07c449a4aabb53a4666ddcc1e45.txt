
Week 1
Since I�m recovering from last week, I�m not going to focus on working out too much this week. 
The main thing is getting back to eating clean. Three small meals a day, with snacks in between. No soda, sweet tea, or lemonade�just more water.

Sadly I can�t give up coffee juuuust yet. But I have faith that I�ll do fine this week. 
Eat clean and be happy.
