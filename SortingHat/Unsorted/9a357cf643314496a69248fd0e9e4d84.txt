
Meant to take a picture of my breakfast bc it looked so pretty, but I was too hungry and forgot! It was SO yum, though. I had a smoothie (plain nonfat yogurt, 1 banana, blueberries, almond milk, and frozen strawberry/raspberry medley) and a multigrain english muffin with strawbery preserve :)

It was actually more of a brunch bc I slept in today heheï¿½.
