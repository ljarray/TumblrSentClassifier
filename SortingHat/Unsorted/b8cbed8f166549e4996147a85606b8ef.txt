
The Perfect Girl
<p> Everyone seems to want the perfect girl <br />

  Beauty from head to toe <br />

I do too <br />

<p> I want beautiful hair <br />

  Styled to accentuate her unique personality <br />

<p> I want beautiful eyebrows <br />

  Showing honesty in every expression <br />

<p> I want beautiful eyes <br />

So when I look into them <br />

I see her compassionate soul <br />

<p> I want a beautiful nose <br />

To use to pick the freshest flowers <br />

<p> I want beautiful lips <br />

That say the kindest words <br />

To both loved ones and strangers <br />

<p> I want beautiful teeth <br />

That light up the room when smiling <br />

<p> I want a beautiful chest <br />

To rest my head on <br />

And hear her comforting heartbeat <br />

<p> I want a beautiful stomach <br />

To enjoy great meals with <br />

<p> I want beautiful arms <br />

To pick me up when I?m down <br />

<p> I want beautiful legs <br />

Strong from several hard day?s work <br />

<p> And most importantly, <br />

I want beautiful feet <br />

To walk alongside me <br />

Wherever I choose to go <br />
