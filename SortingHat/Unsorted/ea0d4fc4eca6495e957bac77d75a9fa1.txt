
Here we go!
So. I think I want to start blogging about my journey with Whole30. I�ve tried so many diets before and nothing worked, except one. Herbalife. While I enjoyed Herbalife, I have found that the reason it works is because you have so much motivation around you. I hated the shakes. I honestly don�t believe meal replacements are for me. I�m Italian. I like to eat! I like real food. I did lose about 20 pounds with Herbalife and when I tried it again after months of not using it, I failed. I hated it. The problem with shakes and all of those meal replacements is that it�s NOT a lifestyle. It�s a filler. At least, to me, it is.

I want to start my Whole30 journey with you. I really love the principal that you don�t eat anything that isn�t natural. It�s. All. Clean. And it�s a lifestyle. I want to see the way my body changes without sugar, without grains, without legumes, without all of these foods that cause health issues. I want to see how good I feel. It�s not just to lose weight, it�s to feed my body true food. To find my food sensitivities. To just feel good.

I know this will be hard, especially for 30 days but I have a couple friends doing it with me, so I think I can do it. But it�s also why I want to blog about it, it�ll keep me accountable! I�ll be posting pictures of my food and talking about other things along this journey. I�m nervous but ready!
