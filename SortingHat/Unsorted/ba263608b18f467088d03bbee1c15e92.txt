
Bad Picture Monday: Loving Yourself Right Now

?A picture is worth a thousand words: An old saying that many of us recognize. So I would love to know what our selfies say.

For most of us, selfies mean our best photos. And, most times, taking a great selfie is a full-on production. You have to find the right angle, the right lighting, and the right caption.

I have perfected my selfies over time. My best angle is a slight tilt, but not a full-on profile. I prefer natural lighting, but white lighting works as well. I go for a closed-mouth smile, with pursed lips adorned in typically pink or red lipsticks. It?s my own personal tried-and-true formula for my best and favorite selfies. When I don?t follow this model, I?m more than likely just gonna delete the photo and try again.

But why?

Why do I go through all of this work for a picture of myself? What?s wrong with posting a photo straight on in horrible lighting? Photos not using the formula that I created for myself are usually the most honest portrayals of what I look like. Why is that considered bad?

The number of selfies we take and delete because they don?t meet our standards is probably astronomical! Think of how many pictures you take before you post your selfie. And think of how many filters you toggle through before you finalize your selection.?
