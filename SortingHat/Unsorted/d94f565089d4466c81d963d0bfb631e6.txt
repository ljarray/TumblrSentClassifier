
major super duper ed tw
I just found this old letter / list from around this time last year I wrote that was like a ?summer plan? about like food stuffs that was so disturbing to read? it said this, 

Stay motivated! 

- Use lose it! more ( a terrible calorie counting app) 

- No desserts whatsoever 

- Try to stay under 400 (calories a day??? like wtf) 

- Do laps an hour AT LEAST three times a week

- This is for you and for Summer (a girl I was dating at the time) 

- I believe in you and love you!!

It was literally like reading a letter from my eating disorder like none of it is logical and the fucking I love you at the end is so distorted like I honestly thought I was taking care of myself. fuck.
