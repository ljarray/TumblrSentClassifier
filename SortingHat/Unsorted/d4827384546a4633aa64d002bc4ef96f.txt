Dinner I made a quick, dairy free, vegan friendly chocolate pudding using avocado as the base. I mixed in a handful of almonds, a handful of semisweet baking chocolate chips, half of an avocado, two large spoonfuls of peanut butter, two large spoonfuls of honey, and a spoonfuls worth of cocoa baking powder. It was a substantial batch, so I only had a couple of spoonfuls so that I can save it for when I have sugar cravings.
