
Sometimes out loud I�ll say what I feel about me being fat.
Since I�m on vacation I�m eating a lot more then usual so I feel even shitty-er about myself.
My sister keeps telling me to �just say it in your head, God I�m tired of hearing it!�

�.

WELL GOD DAMMIT I ALWAYS SAY IT IN MY HEAD EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY!!!
DONT MAKE ME FEEL WORSE!!!!
