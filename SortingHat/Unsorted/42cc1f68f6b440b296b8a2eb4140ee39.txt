
Giving up the grubby stuff
My weight has become absurd. I weigh nearly as much as when I was full term with finley.

A week or so ago I signed up to a challenge to eat clean for three months to try and break free of the bad habits I�m in.

Looking at my other posts it doesn�t bode that well for full compliance but I�m going to do my best because something has to be done. I�ll talk about the rules another time though.

Day one was yesterday. It was trickier than I thought just fitting it into daily activities so preparation is going to be key.

However well I did yesterday, I�m suffering the withdrawals today. Up very early with a banging headache that as yet won�t shift. The ice pack, paracetamol, ibuprofen, water and ryvita with honey better kick in soon.
