
Fast Metabolism Diet - Day 1
So I know I�m really not one for dieting because it doesn�t bring me any good. But Haylie Pomroy�s diet is something in which you�re eating actual food and you�re eating good food constantly. So I�m taking a chance on this in hopes I will lose something.

Today was Day 1 of Phase 1 which means high carb, moderate protein, low fat

Breakfast - oatmeal w blueberries & raspberries

Snack - 1 orange

Lunch - grilled chicken, carrots, French beans, lettuce & brown-red rice

Snack - 1 banana (I just realized just now that this isn�t on the list of approved foods :((((( )

Dinner - grilled chicken, French beans, lettuce & brown-red rice

I felt pretty good throughout the day, I suppose. I�m having a headache right now though :( I�m also used to eating really low carb, so when I was changing just now I noticed that my stomach looked like I�m 9 months pregnant. Not sure if this is the result of having a high carb day after eating low carb for about a year and half now or maybe I�m bloated?? I have no idea. I did some cardio as well. I�m just gonna stick with this and hope I see some changes. I�m gonna be disciplined and follow this by the book so I don�t waste my efforts.

There�s a dinner party at my house tomorrow and it looks like I�ll barely be able to eat any of the food :( I�ll have to make my own. Oh well. I�m kinda scared to weigh myself tomorrow morning after a high carb day.
