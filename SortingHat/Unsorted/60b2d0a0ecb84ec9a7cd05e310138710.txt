
Parents are so scared of their child being fat its ridiculous. Like they dont even care if theyre healthy as long as they dont look fat. I remember when i was younger my body naturally started getting chunkier and my mom suddenly controlled everything i ate until 7th grade when i naturally slimmed down. Literally everything was controlled like if the teacher gave out candy or a kid bought cupcakes for his birthday i had to call and ask her if i could eat it even though i was perfectly healthy i was involved in multiple sports and had no trouble physically. This idea that fat is bad is so terrible for kids i remember being terrified of being fat for the next 5 years until i realized that even if i got fat again id be beautiful
