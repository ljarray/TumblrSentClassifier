
Okay like, this post is kinda just me ranting really quick. So recently I uploaded my picture of the Dangan Ronpa girls I did to my facebook and my mom saw it and she started going off about how she doesn?t understand why Sakura was so buff while her fiance said that he thought she was a man, but the issue is they wouldn?t drop it after I tried to explain to them since once my mom hears ?It?s anime? She just drops it and doesn?t try to understand. Later I uploaded my progress of the boys on Facebook and my mom just wrote ? I have to say, I find it strange that some girls look like boys and some boys look like girls. I know it?s the characters, just saying??? And it just really bothered me. After some heavy thinking I realized why it bothered me so much. I realized that there are real people with real feelings that go through this exact shit and I wonder how they deal with people judging them like that. If someone reads this and they have body image issues or literally anything that ?Isn?t accepted? in our society I want you to I love you all and you go! <3
