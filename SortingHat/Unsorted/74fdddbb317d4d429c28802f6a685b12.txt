
What keeps me motivated
Whenever I feel like pigging out I put down the ice cream and pick up the salad because I remember why I�m doing it:
- so I can wear a two piece bathing suit
- so I won�t feel bloated & heavy all the time 
- so I can fit in those jeans
- so when I go back to school everyone will go �wow�
- for myself ??
