
What vs. How Much
They say that weight loss and healthy lifestyle is 30% exercise and 70% kitchen. 

This is something that I�ve come to know isn�t exactly true, but still holds some merit. 

The truth: it is actually 100% diet and 100% exercise.

But i�m going to focus on the diet part. 

Theres definitely a scientific and biological difference between certain types of foods, fats, and calories. I�ve noticed that it doesn�t seem to matter, within reason, how much of something you take in, depending on what it is. 

For example, it�s much better to consume 3 cups of spinach rather than 3 cups of ice cream. This is a difference of fats, vitamins, calories, and nutritional value. 

It�s become very important to me in my journey to instead of filling myself up on small things that are full of saturated fats to eat a lot of something will natural fats and sugars.

tl;dr: it�s important to remember the difference between different kinds of food and have the will power to make the healthier choice while being able to eat more of that choice.
