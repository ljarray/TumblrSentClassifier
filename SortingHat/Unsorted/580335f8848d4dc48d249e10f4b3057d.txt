
Day 25: good days and bad days
I feel like everyone has days where they feel like absolute shit about themselves and today was kinda one of those days for me.

I wasn�t feeling my best. For a while now I have been feeling really great and I was happy but today was just kind of an off day. I don�t why really, I guess it was because today is the first time I�ve worn a bathing suit since I started this whole health kick and I guess I�m not seeing as much results wise as I want to.

Hopefully tomorrow will be better. I�m gonna start doing morning yoga again, we�ll see if that helps.
