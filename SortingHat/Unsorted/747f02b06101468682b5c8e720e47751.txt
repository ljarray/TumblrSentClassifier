
�fat� isnt an insult. its just seen as one because social beauty standards say so.

�gay� isnt an insult. its just seen as one because of societies ideal that being heterosexual is what youre supposed to be.

'like a girl� isnt an insult. its just seen as one because of societies idea that women are weaker and inferior to men.

think about the 'insults� youre using, because they could be very normal things but they just happen to be what our shitty society looks down upon.
