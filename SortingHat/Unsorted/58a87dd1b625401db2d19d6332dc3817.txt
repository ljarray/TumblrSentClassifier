
Whenever people say that skinny people can?t cosplay rose quartz it really bothers me, like I?m on the heavier side and I can see how it?d be comforting to cosplay someone of the same body type but saying that is like saying that people who are heavier can?t cosplay skinnier characters? Honestly it?s like saying that I can?t cosplay Pearl just because I?m fat. Every body type is beautiful. Cosplay is about expressing yourself. If someone is thinner and they want to cosplay someone of a different body type, let them - whatever makes you happy.
