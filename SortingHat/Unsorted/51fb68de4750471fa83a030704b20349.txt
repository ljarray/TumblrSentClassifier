
Up and down all the time right?
I have officially lost 20 lbs. I am nearly halfway to my goal weight and it�s been exactly two months since I started going to the nutritionist/weightloss clinic. I was expecting to gain another 5 lbs. Nope! I lost a bunch instead. I�m really quite proud of myself and I can�t wait to see how the rest of this journey goes. I think I need to work on reducing the amount of carbs I eat (more so than I already have) and try to choose fruit and veggies over starches whenever possible. 

Things can�t be all good, though. They never can.

I feel like I am not as strong as I should be, both physically and emotionally. I should be more in shape. I really need to get more exercise. I must have some abs starting under all this fat and I�d like to have a flat(ter) stomach by the time school starts. 

I can�t wait for school. The gym is super cheap and I can go every day if I want. And I won�t be working as much when school starts so I�ll have more time to get strong and healthy.

I also need to work on my friendships and decide if the people I am surrounded by are really good to have around or not. One of my best friends is constantly grabbing at me (I don�t like to be grabbed or touched without warning) and yelling about how skinny I am, but I can feel that she�s trying to make me feel guilty for losing the weight. She constantly puts herself down (I know I can be pretty bad with that, too) and it hurts to see her so unhappy. But it also hurts that she feels the need to put me down and make me feel guilty in order to make herself feel better. I feel like she can�t stand the thought of me having friends and feeling good because that would mean leaving her behind, which is not the case at all. Although, if she continues to treat me like she does, I won�t be able to stay in this friendship for very long. I need kindness and support, not constant guilt trips, jealously and neglect. That shit makes you bloat for real. 



Anyone out there going through some rough times? Anyone out there making good progress?
