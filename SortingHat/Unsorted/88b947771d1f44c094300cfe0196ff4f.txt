
Tay and Nicki
The comments made on Twitter by both girls should alert us to a bigger issue. The issue is not that there was a catfight and shade might have been thrown. Rather, this issue is about how women are seen in the world. Nicki has every right to be upset by the lack representation of certain women; that is darker women, or even ?fuller? curvy (beautiful) women. Nicki was honest and emotionally charged. Admittedly, the wording of one of her tweet could be seen as shade toward Taylor and her ?slim? body. So Taylor responded honestly and emotionally as well. But this interaction highlights the emphasis placed on girls and their body and their image. In my personal opinion, neither girl is in the wrong here, they were personally offended by choices made by others. Choices that can be construed to mean something more.
