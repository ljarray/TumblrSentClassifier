Hey,guys!! <3 
So I decided to make this post for newbies out there who want to start working out and lose some extra pounds.Firstly, I wanna say I wasn?t skinny child like ever, my diet was very unhealthy when i was around 10 years,I would eat out of boredom,when someone else was eating and basically,no one cared bc i was ?just a kid? plus,almost everyone in my family is plus sized so it was normal.In middle school i was constantly surrounded with skinny girls and skinny people and i became very lonely at the age of 14, i was considered that fat friend at least i started to see myself that way.I told myself that the only way i would be happy,have loyal friends,boyfriend etc is if i lose weight.I started to google the best ways to achive my goal and became slightly obssesive with that matter.No one new what was going through my head,i started to count calories and what i eat.Then i saw scale slightly lowering, and i was even more motivated and stopped eating sweets ,drinking soda,bread and ate only so little that would satisfy my ?daily needs?.Everything that i would randomly read online on losing weight i would try out, also i started to work out on a daily basis.(i did push ups,to about 200 a day sometimes even more, and jogg ).My muscles used to hurt so bad,but i didn?t care.People i thought were my best friends started to turn against me, and would tell me that i?m sick and i lost so much weight. And i was sad once again.Losing weight didn?t help at all, i hated going to school and felt judged all the time. I started to eat healthy and continued working out but not that extremely,and felt good about it,but people became even more cruel.I cried constantly and shoved my head into the  pillow and asked myself why am i even doing that, i could?ve stayed fat at least than i wasn?t bullied by my so called friends.I will never forget my best friend telling me ?I was born skinny there is nothing i can do about it.What you are doing is sick.? That stroke me like a bullet through my cheast, so what if i was born fat i should just stay like that.That?s bunch of bullcrap ,everyone is allowed to do whatever they feel is good for them, if you want to cut you hair, CUT IT,if you want to dye your hair,DO IT,society constantly pushes new trends on us and portraits ?perfect bodies? that are impossible to achive bc they are so fake and photoshoped.Yesterday curves where in, today hip bones, and tomorrow something else, people are not objects ,we can?t live up to does standards no one can,Plastic surgeries are becomeing so common that people ,especially girls would rather starve themselves than accept who they are and celebrate their individuality.Every new generation is shoved with does standards thanks to internet and modern technology.I wish that in my lifetime i would be able to see that it doesn?t matter how much money someone makes,or what kind of clothes they wear, but simply to be able to judge the person by their personality and inner beauty.My idea is ?be the best version of yourself,don?t compare your body or abilities to no one, you are unique,special and there is no one like you.??I know that if you are in school all of these is beyond the grasp,but there is only one person that you need to make happy and that is you.Why?Well, people will come and go but you can always count on yourself and if you do everything in your life just to satify others you are setting yourself for one misserable life filled with anger and bitterness. 
 P.S.-you can message me anytime over here or dm me on twitter i would very much like to help anyone who is struggling with any sort of problems,bc i would?ve appreciated it so much if i had someone to talk to in my rough period.Having someone to talk to can make a lot of difference in the world. Love you guys and stay positive <3
