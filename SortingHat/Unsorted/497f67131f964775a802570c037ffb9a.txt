
I will never be what you want me to be and there is nothing you can say or do to change the fact that I am my own person. Not someone?s twisted daydream of a person. I?m sorry I don?t have the purfect body or the purfect and complete personality you want me to have. But I don?t and in your eyes I never will. And I?m expecially sorry I ever accepted you for being yourself when clearly you couldn?t possible do the same for me.
