
no one?s body is ever fully static

some people?s appear more static than others, and some people are in states of great transformation, but all of us are changing all the time

#I will always be transitioning#I like that one thing Kate Bornstein says about transition#I forget the exact quote#but it's in My New Gender Workbook#and the general gist is that we all make gender transitions regardless of our trans status#maybe you went from girl to young woman#or able bodied man to disabled man#our bodies and our genders and our social states are continually shifting#and so are our understandings of them#anyway I'm gonna go do some back exercises now#boring text posts#genderfuckery#body image
