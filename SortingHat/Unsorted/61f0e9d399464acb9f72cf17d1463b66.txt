
I will not be embarrassed
I will not be embarrassed when my thighs jiggle when I walk.

I will not be embarrassed to wear a crop top on a hot day, even if I don?t have a model body.

I will not be embarrassed to like the style of music I like. It makes me happy, so I will keep being a fan of it.

I will not be embarrassed to do stereotypical/?basic? things (i.e. Starbucks). If I like to do it, let me do it. Do not associate it with my race, gender, or age.

I will not be embarrassed of my skin color.

I will not be embarrassed of my sexuality. 

I will not be embarrassed of my gender.

I will not be embarrassed of my age.

I will not be embarrassed of myself.

I will not be embarrassed to be who I am.
