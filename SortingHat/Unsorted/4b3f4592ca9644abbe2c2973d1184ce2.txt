
But more on the subject of booty-revealing clothing
So like, a lot of my clothes haven?t fit super well (/at all) for a few months now. Probably since April. I had to get new bras, a new pair of jeans, and a new pair of leggings. I also bought 2 new dresses on sale at Target, and a couple loose summery things from last year still fit okay. Other than that, stuff is a little too big and not quite right (or completely unwearable after it stretches out a tiny bit) (including panties, sports bras, all workout clothes, all t-shirts, every other pair of leggings I own, all shorts, etc).

Replacing most of this is cost-prohibitive right now and to be honest, a little distressing. It?s also not entirely necessary because I *can* still wear all the things I need to (mostly casual stuff and gym clothes for the summer) and that?s not going to change til the fall. 

Since lifting tanks and sports bras can be replaced cheaply, I may start with those. There?s also the shorts! I wear compression shorts. They don?t really compress much anymore, they ride up in an unflattering way and are full camel mode about an hour into my workout. Dude also recently revealed that when I bend over in them you can ?see straight to Georgia.? So maybe I need to think about the shorts as well.
