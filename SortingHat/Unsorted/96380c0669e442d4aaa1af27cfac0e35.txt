
Day 29: well it something!
Any progress is good progress right?

So I weighed myself today and it�s the first time I have since I�ve started my health kick and this blog! And the results are less than I was expecting. I was expecting that I had lost maybe 5 pounds or so, because I feel and look better than before. But it turned out to only be about 2.

And I know they say that the first ten are the hardest so i�m gonna keep trying! But I have noticed that my body has begun to tone up a bit, so I might not be loosing weight but I am definitely gaining some muscle. I won�t let this slow me down because even if don�t end up loosing a ton of weight, I will still feel good and (hopefully) look good too!!
