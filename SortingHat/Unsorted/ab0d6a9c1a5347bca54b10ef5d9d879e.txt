
Every time
Every time you feel fear whether it be about the future and trying to get it all figured out, or facing a difficult situation, remind yourself to take it one day and one moment at a time. Things always work out in the end.

Every time you question your abilities or say you �can�t� do something whether it be school, a job, or another important part of your life, remind yourself that you are capable and you will do amazing things. The least you can do is try. Mistakes are inevitable.

Every time you begin to feel self hate or shame about your body, remind yourself that those legs allow you to walk and dance..those arms allow you to give hugs to those you love..that stomach allows you to bear a child and digest delicious food.. that butt makes you look damn good in pants and allows you to sit and not have your bone jamming into the chair. Remind yourself that your body is your vessel. Smash that scale and delete that My Fitness Pal account because numbers don�t need to rule your life. Weight and calories are not and never will be more important than your happiness..and when you can see that and believe it, you will feel free.

Every time you feel guilt, shame, embarrassment, disgust, or anxiety after eating a food (s) remind yourself that food is your fuel and that you are allowed to have any kind of fuel that you desire. Other people deserve that ice cream, cake, pizza, French fries, nut butters, avocados, chocolate, and other delicious things, so why is it not the same for you? Think of what you would tell someone else. Food is meant to be enjoyed and you are allowed to eat. You deserve to eat.

Every time you feel like your life has no purpose or that you are useless, think of the people around you and how your presence has touched them. Whether it be your best friend, parents, teachers, siblings, or even that homeless person who you so nicely gave money to; you are of importance. No one�s life is pointless. You were brought onto this Earth for a reason and no matter what anyone tells you or what your mind tells you, the world around you needs you to be included in it. You are a piece of the puzzle. You may feel small and invisible, but you are special in your own way.

Every time you begin to criticize yourself by saying things like �I should be doing this� or �I need to do that,� remind yourself that you�re the way you are for a reason and your life is the way it is supposed to be at this moment in time. There is no rule book of life about how we �should� be living. Just because someone goes to college for 4 years right out of high school, doesn�t mean you should be too. Just because your friends go out to bars and parties, doesn�t mean that you �need� to either. Comparison is the thief of joy. You do you, and be confident in yourself.

Lastly, Every time you feel a moment of happiness or joy, capture it and hold onto it. Keep positive memories stored away to look back on when you are feeling down. Remind yourself that bad moments and feelings will pass, and that there is always beauty in every single day. However, sometimes we have to search a little bit to find it.

�Every sunrise is a challenge, and every sunset is a win.�
