
Weekly Weigh-In
Last week, i weighed myself for the first time in a long time. I was not the heaviest I�ve ever been, but it was still hither than I�d like to admit. But i realized that I need to keep doing that on a regular basis to keep me on track. So my plan is to weigh myself weekly and post my progress here. At this point, I�m not comfortable saying what the starting weight is, but maybe I�ll get to that point.

This week, by eating healthy and being more active, I�ve lost 2 pounds!
