
Gonna talk about some body positivity real quick.

Thyroid problems run in my family, and so most of us have a lot of trouble losing weight. I haven?t gotten the results back, but I probably have something going on there. So I?ve decided to switch from a ?must lose weight? mindset, and instead trying to work with I have. I can look good if I try, so that?s what I?m gonna do. I will cosplay without shame, and not torture myself for not looking like the popular, mainstream, skinny cosplayers. I look damn fine sometimes, and I?m gonna own it.
