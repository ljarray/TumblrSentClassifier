
So, who wants to help me pass this college course?

That?s right, all of you do!

For my Gender and Women?s Studies? class, each of us were required to make some sort of project to raise awareness in some way. Me? I chose the (very painful) idea of conducting a survey!

Here it is for all you wonderful people trying to help Andy pass college.

At the end you can view most data but I?m compiling everything together to throw in a report. Part one is this survey, which needs LOTS of people to weigh in in order to do part two. So, come on! Fill it out, it?s ten questions and shouldn?t take you more than five minutes! I really want an A in this class.

But please, be honest. No pretending to be other people or fictional characters.

Spread it around as much as you can. I have until July 23rd to gather all the results and start working.
