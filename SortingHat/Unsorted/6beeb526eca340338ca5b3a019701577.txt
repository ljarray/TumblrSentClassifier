
Day 42: simple changes
So I wanted to talk about some little changes I�ve seen in my body since we�ve all embarked on this journey together that I have seen.

One thing I use to be really self conscious of was my arms! I had this little piece of fat that would poke out over my elbow when my arm was completely straight. And I use to hate it, I would wear shirts all the time that would cover it but now� It�s almost completely gone! So obviously I�ve made some improvements!!

So I guess I just want to say, notice the changes guys! Even if they are minor baby fat on your arms. They are signs of progress and that is stellar!!

Breakfast:
Vanilla protein shake 
Blue gaterode

Lunch: 
Chicken Noodle soup
Iced hibiscus tea

Snack:
A hard boiled egg

Dinner:

Cardio:25 minutes (hey you gotta start somewhere!)
Steps:4,326

I�m slowly recovering, but I hope your day was wonderful!

Love, Jenna ??
