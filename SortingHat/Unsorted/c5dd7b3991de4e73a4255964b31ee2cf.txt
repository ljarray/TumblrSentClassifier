
Unpopular opinion, I know,  but I just want to get it off my chest.

Something that really disturbs me on tumblr and on a lot of other websites, is how people will put down thin girls, or skinny girls, by invalidating their body type and saying that they?re not ?real women?.

This has been going on so much by other women, and I just can?t stand it. Yeah, some of us are paper thin, we?re as thin as twigs, but that?s our body type, we?re real women. Some people struggle with it, you know, struggle with their thinness, and to invalidate them because of your own securities is fucking childish and immature and I just don?t know what to say anymore.

It?s not always easy to get a thin body, for some girls it takes work, it takes determination, it takes willpower. Do you know how it feels when you shame people for getting their desired body type?

These girls are proud of themselves for their body type, and you  have the nerve to say they aren?t ?real women? because of their weight, because they?re thin?

Listen guys, there?s no need to put down one body type just to raise another one. You feminist are so accepting, except when a certain types of  women feel confident in themselves. That?s why i?m not a feminist.

Like they say, no one is harder on women more than other women.
