
I�m going to take this weekend to relearn clean eating. SO tomorrow I have EVOC training from 9-5 and then I work 5-11. I have to figure out a clean dinner but I made a huge strawberry banana and chocolate protein smoothie just in case. It smells delicious and I can�t wait to have it. It�s about 250 calories for the whole thing.

Saturday im having a date with Brucie and seeing a movie so I�m cooking at home for him. Sunday idk what I�m having but I�m going to try and make it healthy. Monday starts workout P90X time and going to buy 2 sets of weights and some kettle bells before I cancel my LA Fitness membership.

My goals will happen, I will have my dream body back.I have all the resources now and no excuses.
