Just watched the film, ?Amreeka? ! It was sooo beautiful and sad and heartwarming ugh. So great. It?s a good heartfelt movie. It truly depicts the struggle that immigrants coming to the US face. My family and I can relate to so many things that happen in the movie. ?? I feel like it?s a great eye opening film for judgmental and ignorant people who hate on middle eastern cultures/ nationalities. I also freaking loved Alia Shawkat in this movie!!!! Love social issue debating woke people! Ugh! So great. Also the character Fadi in the film reminded me of my boyfriend. ???? SUCH A GREAT MOVIE. Now I wanna party with my family and eat some baklava.
