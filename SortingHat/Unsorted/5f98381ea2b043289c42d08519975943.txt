
Happy Healthy ME
As you know, I�ve been struggling with chronic fatigue syndrome for over two years now, and prior to that I had glandular fever, chronic tonsillitis and a whole host of ongoing health problems. I also struggled with calorie restriction, binge eating, over exercising, and terrible body image for 10+ years. By this point, after years of abusing my body and putting up with so much ill health, I�m understandably very frustrated and fed up with always being sick! It�s time to take charge of my health and finally be HAPPY HEALTHY ME!

So, I�ve starting drafting a little plan to help get my health back on track. It�s a work in progress, I�m going to trial this for a few weeks and adjust it as I go. I also need to make allowances for when I am feeling sick and tired. The key to recovering from chronic fatigue is to know when you�re at your limit and allow yourself to rest. Pushing yourself just doesn�t work in this case! I need to work on creating structure and routine within my days, especially my days off from work. 

Morning Routine

up by 8am (unless I really need a sleep in)
1 litre of lemon water
2 tbsp blackstrap molasses, vitamin B12, vitamin D3
20-30 minute walk
stretching, physiotherapy, strength work (about 30 mins)
10 minute meditation
HCLF fruit-filled breakfast
shower, wash face, clean teeth
studying by 9:30-10ish
Nutrition

currently trialling a HCLF, high raw diet. At this point I�m still working out what works best for me nutritionally. I LOVE eating lots of fruit, but am open to adjusting my macros depending on what I feel works best for me. Also being winter, I�m definitely craving hearty, warming meals! So this will be one I�m working on over time. 
eat some raw veggies every day
[mostly] gluten free. I always eat gluten free at home, but will occasionally eat it when out - and only in small amounts! I have a mild gluten intolerance, but a little seems to go okay.
fresh pressed juice daily
Fitness

20 - 30 minute walk daily - this is as much about getting me out of the house on my days off so I don�t become a hermit as it is just getting me up and moving. Plus I love walking! It�s so calming, refreshing and just feels so dang good.
4 x dance classes per week
1 - 2 yoga classes per week
stretching, physiotherapy and strength work daily - one thing I REALLY need to focus on, is getting my strength back up! Obviously dancing helps a lot, but I still have very little upper body and core strength, and with my many injuries (back, shoulders, foot, knee) building up some muscle is the best way to heal and prevent any more from occurring. 
in a few weeks I will also think about getting another jazzercise membership. It�s so much fun, so good for fitness, and it�s something that my mum, sisters and I all do together. Family bonding AND fitness?! Yep. I just need to be sure I�m not going to be overdoing it by taking on too much first.
Mind

10 minute daily meditation/mindfulness
10 minutes of reading each day
write in journal daily
Study

do a little each day
NO PHONE!
study like Hermione
So basically I�m hoping my days will go something like this:

get up and do Morning Routine
study from 10am til about 4 or 5pm
have a lunch break but NOT take a nap like I usually do - this makes me sleepy and ends in a very unproductive afternoon! It�s also not good for your night time sleeping habits/sleep quality
stop studying by 5pm at the latest
eat a wholesome, nutritious dinner
do some reading before bed
be in bed by 10pm - structured, regular bed times are really important to create good quality sleeping habits
BUT in saying all this, I�m aware that some days I will just not feel up to sticking to this. Some days I will be tired and feeling unwell, and will just need a day on the couch binge watching Pretty Little Liars and napping. And that�s a-ok too. Slowly building up consistent, healthy habits is my ultimate goal, but I need to take it slow and not rush. There is no quick fix for chronic fatigue, and pushing myself will only be detrimental. Some weeks I will probably not exercise at all except for my dance classes, and there�s nothing wrong with that.

Slow progress is STILL PROGRESS!
