
If someone calls you fat, don?t add to the stigma of the word by acting like that?s the worst thing someone calls you. I don?t care if you?re 100lbs or 300lbs, I don?t care if ?it?s all muscle?, I don?t care if you?re ?thick not fat?, just fucking own it. Don?t tell other people that big is beautiful, be proud of your body, and all that other shit when you?re just going to turn around and ?prove? to everyone that it?s not arm fat because you lift.

Fuck all your pseudo body positivity.
