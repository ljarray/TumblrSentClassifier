
Nicki Minaj and her video do not stand for women who are not represented in today?s media. She represents the same slim waisted/big boobs/ big ass that have been portrayed in hip hop since it began. I mean come on. She wants to talk about realistic bodies when hers is as unrealistic as it gets. Please don?t fall for it people. These celebrities are riding the coat tails of the ?trendy feminism movement? to get promotion and make more money. They could care less about civil rights or equality. They only want MONEY.
