
i joined the gym so i�m trying to eat heathy and all that jazz. The thing is i already don�t eat anything fried or refined and i can�t really eat much processed stuff (being a vegan in a third world country lol) so i have no idea what i�m doing. I joined myfitnesspal and it says i need to consume 1300k a day and i�m tracking what i eat and i�m eating exactly as much as i did before. I�m getting really confused and can�t afford a vegan nutricionist so i don�t know. Should i cut out all flours and doughs? (i eat mostly whole wheat pita bread and corn fajitas and chips) should i focus on eating more legumes? should i try to eat more times a day? idk someone pls orient me
