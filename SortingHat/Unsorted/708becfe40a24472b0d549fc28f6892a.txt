Although I am deeply saddened that Luke does not like the name breadstick, we should all respect this choice. Also I?ve seen posts talking about calling him similar words like noodle, spaghetti, etc.

Now I am speculating completely but as someone who has struggled for a long time with body image issue around my how thin I am/my lack or curves I have to wonder if this may be an issue Luke is facing.

Although you all mean it as a term of endearment it may resonate badly with him. Society tells men they need to be buff, strong, and smooth, not lanky and thin. We all know Luke is a beautiful human being and he may actual have 0 flaws but obviously he cannot see that

So I am, on behalf of anyone and everyone who has ever struggled with body image, asking you all to respect Luke and call him by more friendly names like penguin and blondie.

Thank you for reading
