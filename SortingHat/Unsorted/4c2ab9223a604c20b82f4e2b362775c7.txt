
I�m not a nutritionist but I thought I might as well share some of my tips for better nutrition for your kids. 

(Obviously you should avoid/limit all candy, sugary snacks and chips besides what I�m listing here, but I would hope that goes without saying.)



DO

Get a food grinder, and opt for fresh veggies and fruits over store bought baby food any day. Really avoiding processed food in general is the key to cutting back on forming early, excess sugar and salt predispositions. 

Start them early. The sooner they get a taste for good, healthy food the better. 

Stop being a push over.  �He refuses to eat unless he gets what he wants�. Okay, too bad for him. Your kid is just trying to see if they can get their way. They aren�t really �never going to eat again�. They�ll cave by dinner time and eat whatever you give them once they see you won�t budge and let them have donuts for a meal. Your spoiled 6 � year old won�t die if they miss a single lunch because they threw a tantrum over broccoli. Be sure to give them lots of options though so they aren�t stuck with something they really, truly do hate to eat. Here are some healthy lunch options. And some for school lunches as well. 

When they were a baby you fed them milk/formula until they accepted it no matter how much they might have wailed or spit it out, because that�s the only option they had. Eventually they got hungry enough they would eat it. Same method works just fine on older kids too. 

Pinterest is your friend. 



AVOID

 
Sugary cereal. Heck, limit cereal in general because even the outwardly non- sugary appearing ones still pack more than most people are aware.  Most kids get their first introduction, and addiction, to sugary snacks through cereal.

Canned veggies, opt for frozen when you can because canned veggies have a lot of added sugar and sodium. 

Processed lunch meats. I see processed lunch meats in so many �healthy� adult and children�s lunchbox recipes. Despite the tempting ease and seemingly healthy appearance of packing some lean turkey lunch meat �it�s actually really terrible for you. It packs more preservatives than most other forms of meat. And it�s again high in a lot of added sodium. Btw this includes hot dogs.

Same goes for bagels.
