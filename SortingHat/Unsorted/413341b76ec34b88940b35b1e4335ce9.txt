
Today�s affirmation: I love and accept myself unconditionally

So often, I hear myself thinking: �I�ll wear that dress when I�m x pounds, I don�t deserve care/attention/ etc.� All kinds of nonsense drenched with self hate. To accomplish our goals, we need to learn self acceptance.

This is a reminder that you must love yourself at every step of your journey.

Rather than think �I�m only worthy of love/care/attention when I hit this goal,� you must believe in your strength at every step! If we try to accomplish our goals while tangled in self hate, we will falter along the way. Accept and affirm your body and mind, no matter where you are in your journey. (zionlifts)
