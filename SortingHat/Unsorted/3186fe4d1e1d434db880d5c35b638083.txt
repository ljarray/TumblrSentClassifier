
Greek Pizza with Feta, spinach and olives
via inquiringchef

INGREDIENTS

1 recipe of pizza dough (I use this one)
2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 red onion, sliced thin
4 ounces fresh spinach, roughly chopped
2 red pepper halves roughly chopped
ï¿½ cup kalamata olives, halved
6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled


INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven as it heats up.
Stretch the pizza dough into rounds and drizzle with olive oil.
Top each pizza with red onion, spinach, red pepper, kalamata olives and feta cheese. 
Bake until the feta and the crust turn golden brown, about 10-12 minutes. Remove the pizzas and serve.
