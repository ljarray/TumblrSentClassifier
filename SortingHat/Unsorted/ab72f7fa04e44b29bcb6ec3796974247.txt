
we gotta start differentiating between ?plus size? and fat models because the industry doesn?t and just thinks a size eight is representation we should all praise them for

visually, politically and supportively, there?s obviously a huge difference between a size 8 model and a size 22 model. we gotta hold these companies responsible for the image they insist on promoting. we can?t give them credit for being representative of all bodies when they do the least possible to get the accolades they want (in this case, using ?plus size? models to represent body diversity)

that?s not to say a size eight woman doesn?t deserve that job or to be included, but if we don?t demand they do better then they have no reason to do so.
