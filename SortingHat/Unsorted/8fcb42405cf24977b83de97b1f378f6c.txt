
You know what, fat can be beautiful. If you?re confident in your own skin that is great. No one should make fun of fat people, no one should discriminate against fat people and there should be none of that. Its wrong, and unnecessary, and something we should change in our society.

However guess what. They?re medical facts staring you in the face when you have an over abundance of weight. If a doctor tells you to loose weight for your health you should probably listen to them. Shockingly extra weight can cause health problems. And I?m not talking about the twenty five pounds someone thinks they should loose with a little of diet and exercise. I?m talking about when you get into the range of obesity. 

Being positive and happy in your own skin is fucking amazing. However there is a difference between being body positive and ignoring medical facts. People getting butt hurt about statistics are getting butt hurt about their lifestyle. Insults and facts are two different things.
