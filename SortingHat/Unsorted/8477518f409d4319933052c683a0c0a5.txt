
Little-Known Foods that Burn Extra Calories
These foods give your body more energy to burn calories. The more energy you have, the faster and harder you can burn those little buggers away!! Here is a list of unexpected foods that help you to burn calories:

Steak (vigorous chewing burns more calories)
Frozen Pita Bread (Bread looses the yeast calories when frozen, and since yeast is so important to bread, the calorie cut is drastic)
Chicken Nuggets (you�ve seen those videos warning us about what�s in nuggets. The body naturally works harder to break down the components of the nuggets, burning more calories)
Beef Jerky (super hard to chew, right? Exactly. Burn those cals, jaw!)
Chocolate-Covered Frozen Butter (Frozen, butter�s molecular structure changes slightly, rendering it less caloric. The chocolate is optional, but is for a more sensitive palette)
Cotton Candy (although this fluffy snack is sugary, the air you consume while eating it is 4-7 times more dense than the snack. The nutrients in the O2 counteract the sugar, giving you a lovely option to add to your hipster tumblr feed)
