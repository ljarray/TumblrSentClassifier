
Keto Pancakes!
One thing that I suffer with on Keto is the continuous eggs and bacon for breakfast. I mix it up between scrambled, fried and poached, but at the end of the day, an egg is an egg! So, when I can, which is normally on the weekends when I have more time, I love nothing more than making Keto pancakes!

Most recipes are a mix of almond meal and eggs and milk/cream. Others are simply cream cheese and eggs (these look more like crepes). With the almond meal ones, some are just too stodgy, and after experimenting with about 5 different recipes, I�ve created my own! These are tried and tested many times, and my fianc�e loves them! We enjoy ours with whipped cream and sugar free maple syrup and bacon!

Here�s the recipe:
4 large eggs
180 grams of Cream Cheese (one tub of Philadelphia full fat is what I use)
 2 Tbsp almond flour
2 Tbsp cream
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp vanilla essence 
Sweetener to taste (I add tsp of stevia truvia, but it�s personal preference)
I blast everything in my magic bullet, let the mixture sit for 10 minutes and then cook them on a medium-low heat. Be careful to not overcook them. Mine turn out quite thin, but they have a little bit more to them than the cream cheese and egg ones, and they taste so yummy!

From my calculations, there�s 5 net carbs in the entire batch, and it�s about 775 calories (more if you use different types of sweetner, like honey for example). They make enough for 2 HUGE portions, so, really, they probably make 3-4 portions depending how piggy you feel�!

I�ll post a photo, but we gobble them up so quickly normally, hence why I don�t have one!
