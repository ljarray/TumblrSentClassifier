
�My Diet Starts on Monday�*
We�ve already done our introductory post, but I�d like to add in my own personal two cents as well.

I�m �Bridget Jones�, in that I have a love/hate relationship with my body, I�m constantly creating self-improvement plans that fizzle out in a few weeks� time, and I�m perpetually single (With no Colin Firth or Hugh Grant in sight).

I do consider myself fairly healthy, but I can still improve my eating habits, and i definitely don�t get nearly as much exercise as I should. So, my goal starting tomorrow is to work my way up to a consistent 10000 steps daily. Easy enough during the school year, not so much while I�m on break. As I improve I�m going to start adding other mini challenges for myself.

Other things that I�ll be posting include diy beauty (honey facemasks and such), minimalism tips, productivity hacks (ha!), and a commentary on my exceedingly average existence.

Enjoy!

~Bridget
