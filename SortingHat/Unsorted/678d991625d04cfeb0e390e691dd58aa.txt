My weight to age ratio was at its worst from 4th grade until 9th grade. I was wearing baggy clothes to hide my fat rolls, and I started changing in the bathroom stalls during gym class because my stretch marks were starting to show. I wasn�t happy, and I wasn�t taking care of myself. I hated how I was so much that I don�t have any full body pictures of myself during those years because I refused to let my body be recorded.

Junior Year was when I tried loving myself more due to the inspiration from my drama troupe. And it really payed off. I started taking pride in my looks, and my confidence skyrocketed. I wore makeup, I fixed my hair, and I wore clothes that flattered my curves, rather than hid them.

I still struggle with how I look and how much I weigh, but for now, I am proud of myself. All 170 pounds of me ;)
