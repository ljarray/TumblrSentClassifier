
Soy and Sesame Tofu with Noodles

Serves 2

Ingredients:

Mixed vegetables of your choice (I�m using broccoli, carrot, green pepper and sweetcorn)
1 block of firm tofu
Noodles (I�m using dried egg noodles)
Coconut oil (for wok frying)
1 chilli
For the sauce

2 tablesooons of soy sauce
1 and a half tablespoons of toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon of soybean paste
2 cloves of garlic
1 thumb sized chunk of ginger
Prepare the tofu in advance so that the water is drained. Once satisfied, carefully cut the tofu into square chunks and leave to one side. Bring a pan of water to the boil and add the noodles, drain, add a tablespoon of oil, carefully mix and leave to cool. This will prevent the noodles from sticking. Place all of the ingredients for the sauce into a blender and mix until smooth.

Place a wok on heat, add the oil, then add the tofu and stir fry for a minute until slightly browned. Add the sauce and mix together with the tofu. Add the vegetables, stir fry until the vegetables are steaming hot. Finally add the noodles and mix well. Serve immediately.
