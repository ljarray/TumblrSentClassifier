
Teriyaki Quorn Stir Fry

Serves 2

Ingredients:

1 tablespoon of toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon of coconut oil
Thumb sized chunk of garlic
2 garlic cloves
1 chilli
5 tablespoons of soy sauce
150g Quorn �chicken pieces�
Mixed vegetables of your choice
Sesame seeds
4 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce
You can use rice or noodles for this dish, I chose to use basmati rice. Make sure if you are boiling your rice, to have it ready before you preare any of your ingredients to go into the wok. Prepare your essential wok ingredients (garlic, chilli and ginger) by finely chopping all three. Place a wok on high heat, add the coconut and toasted sesame oil and then add the garlic, chilli and ginger. After about 10-15 seconds, add the Quorn and mix well with the oil and spice (always keep an eye on your wok to ensure the Quorn isn�t sticking). After about 8 minutes add the vegetables, teriyaki and soy sauce and again mix well. When the vegetables are piping hot, plate up and to finish, sprinkle the sesame seeds on top.
