
Popcorn
Air-popped popcorn is perfect, it barely has any calories, and it taste yummy be careful for butter though, that has a ton, what I do is; I make ï¿½ cup (15 or so calories) of popcorn and add 1 tsp of butter (100 calories, but it will fill you up for a while) and I mix the butter with some water, it makes the popcorn a little soggy but then you feel like you have more butter, then I add some salt. But better yet just eat it without butter.
