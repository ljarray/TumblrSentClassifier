
Dear pro ana... From the APA community who have suffered real ED's.
I think I can speak for all of us when I say this, if not, any of the APA�s please feel free to correct me if I�m wrong.

Pro ana can be triggering as fuck to people who have suffered real ED�s and it�s also extremely insulting, and dangerous. When you post thinspo, you suggest that we should all look like the emaciated, unhealthy, malnourished people in the pictures. When you make your little pro ED tips & tricks, you�re insulting everyone that has suffered, is suffering or has died from an ED, by making what they did seem like a choice. For you it�s a choice. For us it�s the farthest thing from it.

ED�s are deadly. They are not a goal, a fad, a crash diet, or an aim. Stop putting your pro ana shit in the anorexia/ED/bulimia/EDNOS/UFED/OSFED tags because none of you are actually suffering these diseases and you�re making a mockery of the people who do/did.

If it�s �just for you� put it on a password protected fucking blog where the whole world can�t see it in the click of a button.

You might want to �stop eating until they take you to the hospital�, but we sure as hell don�t and for some of us, your pro ana bulshit may actually trigger us enough to put us there.

And don�t you DARE put your pro ana shit in the recovery tags. The recovery tags are for people recovering from REAL ED�s, not ignorant pro anas who want to see your triggering, harmful content.

Imagine your younger sibling/future or even current daughter or son seeing pro ana. My younger sister, who is only 11, was unfortunate enough to come across these posts and only knew that it was wrong and bad and stupid when I told her that it was. Young, vulnerable, impressionable people also use this site and the Internet in general, and you, pro anas, are teaching them a) that eating disorders are a trendy choice and something to aim for, when we are trying to promote awareness about the dangers of real ED�s, b) that the unhealthy bodies portrayed in your thinspo bulshit pictures are what they should really look like, and c) that it would be marvellous if they were that thin and they got diagnosed with an eating disorder. Remember that.

Also, your shitty little disclaimers mean nothing. And you�ll get reported anyway. In fact, when members of the APA community see your disclaimers saying 'I promote nothing lovelies!!1!!1!1� it generally means you definitely are pro ana/pro mia/pro ED. It�s not a 'release� or 'self expression� if it�s hurting you and other people.
Just don�t.
