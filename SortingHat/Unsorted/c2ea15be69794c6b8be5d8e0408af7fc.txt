
My first experience of We Bare Bears.
So We Bare Bears is another show that has animals as the main characters. To me it seems like a fun show. 3 bears getting into trouble. Whether itï¿½s a missing backpack with a wallet and cell phone or trying to be internet famous gaining tons of friends. Grizz seems to be the protagonist of the group. Making all of the decisions and crazy ideas. Panda seems to be the nervous sensitive type, skeptical about some ideas yet seems to care about his personal items (His phone and dating profile). Ice Bear is the mono-toned type character. Everything he says is mostly a short sentence. Yet his actions have more meaning.
