
Today, i went swimming with a friend. I haven?t been in a good place lately in my mind and also regarding body image. But today at least the body image thing went uphill again. I found that i can totally rock a bikini. my body is strong and healthy and beautiful. i swam about thirty lines today. it felt good, and i noticed, the only person caring about that little belly pooch is me. 
trust me, when i take off my shirt, nobody would look on my belly ;)
