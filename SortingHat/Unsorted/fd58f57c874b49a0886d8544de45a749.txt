
I think one of my issues with the current point in the body positive movement (on the drawing/art side) is that it tends to focus on either ?large? or ?skinny,? but everything else is more or less proportioned the same (especially in female characters)

So like, the default is a thin girl with a narrow waist and wider hips, and then the body-positive-version is a larger girl with a narrow waist and large hips/butt. In some cases, the waist is almost the same even, and the stomach?s still flat. But like?the entire body is dynamic and interesting, and variation can occur not just in terms of fat deposits around the hips. What about wider shoulders? Boxier torso? Thicker arms? Round bellies? Narrow hips? Knobby knees? Flat butts? Even just bad posture? 

#which is something I need to do better with too#if I ever get around to actually designing my ocs for real#or even drawing#drawing characters other than karkat or the strilalondes#hi my names gloomy and im an artist who doesnt art#body image
