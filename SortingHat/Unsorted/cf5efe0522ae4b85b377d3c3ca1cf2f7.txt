
I am a person too.
It is ridiculous how whenever I am on the internet, if someone doesn?t like what I have to say, they will automatically resort to insulting something about my physical appearance instead of trying to actually think of a more clever way to ?prove that they are right.? So for example, if someone disagrees with my opinion, instead of stating why that is or their opinion, they say things like I have a double chin, that I?m a fat ass, etc. So what, I am overweight, doesn?t give you the right to treat people like shit. People come in different shapes and sizes, and you do not know what kind of life the person you are making fun of has had, maybe they just can?t take it anymore. If you have problems in you?re life too, please don?t take it out on someone else. It?s a vicious cycle of hatred.
