
Blessed is my transsexual body for holding me up even when I am broken.
Holy is my cunt for renewing my joy in myself.
Hallowed is my breath for bringing me passion.
I always know love in all of its forms.
I love myself forever and into the timelessness.
I choose to gently accept that there is much I donï¿½t know.
I choose to accept my wounds, my pain, my sacrifices, my scars, my aches, my desires, my pleasures, my passions, my dreams, my goals, my fires, my waters, my wants, my needs, my life.
I choose my Sovereign Self in all my dignity, happiness, and strength.
