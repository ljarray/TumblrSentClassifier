
Tied Up
You are one of us:
If you choke late at night
When there are words there that cannot get past the lump in your throat;
If you can think of a thousand reasons why your skin doesn?t fit
But must believe whatever theory hurts the most;
If you see the thunderstorms inside others? heads
But cannot reconcile this with your own dark clouds;
If you shake in the dark for fear of the shadows
Even though you know your demons stay in the light;
If you see the room spin and blame your careless eyes
When you were not the one to mix the cocktail in your hand;
If you hear raised voices and assume they are for you-
Then you are one of us.

You are never alone.
