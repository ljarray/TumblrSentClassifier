
I really hope that one day attractive people stop getting treated better than others like no hate towards ?attractive? people but the fact that people are treated better bc of how they look is sickening especially when you aren?t considered ?attractive? and have to deal with being treated lesser than someone else based on the prejudice against your appearance
