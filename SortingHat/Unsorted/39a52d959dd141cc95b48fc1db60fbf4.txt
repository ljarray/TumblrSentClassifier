
rant. you can keep scrolling. i just need to vent.
My neighbor is really rude and annoying sometimes and I don?t think she realizes it. She?s like my 3rd grandmother, we consider her family and she lives 20 feet from us so she?s over constantly.

She?s really self conscious about her weight. It came up in a conversation and I told her how much I weighed and she made this cringe face and told me and my sister we needed to start walking. I weigh the normal amount for my age, I?m on the skinny side but yet she still insists that I?m getting fat and I?m not healthy. She thought my anxiety problems were from me eating so much and not exercising. She?s obsessed with eating healthy and exercising. Just now, Mary called me downstairs to look at something for her art and I told her ?I?m too lazy right now text it to me.? And my neighbor chimed in ?yeah, you are lazy you better get up and get movin?.? It?s really rude and it doesn?t help on the days where I?m not feeling confident about my body.

Just cuz she?s self conscious about her own body doesn?t mean she needs to make me self conscious about mine.

Okay, rant over.
