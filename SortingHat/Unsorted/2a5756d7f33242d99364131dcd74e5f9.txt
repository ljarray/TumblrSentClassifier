Today was an even better day depression-wise. That may have something to do with the fact that I decided to quit my job. Between the anxiety caused by political BS and them doing a bait-and-switch with my pay, it was not worth my health. And this challenge is all about my health, mental and physical. 

I took a rest day from exercise because I�m incredibly sore and still feeling very lethargic. I took another nap today. But I went on two very long walks and got my 10k steps in. Tomorrow I�ll try to do some yoga and go for a run.
