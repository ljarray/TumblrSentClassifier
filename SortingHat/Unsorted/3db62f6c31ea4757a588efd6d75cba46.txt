
Ok, i�ve had it with iifym. It�s making my binging worse. When I eat clean for a while my binging stops. Eating sweet things so often just makes me crave it. If I want something sweet, I�ll have the real deal and account for it� but I�ve had enough of the binges.



I just put all my �iifym� food down the garbage disposal after eating three quest bars and a million bites of this or that. two pints of ice cream & chocolate chips. down the garbage disposal. the most �processed� food I�m going to allow in my apartment from now on is just rice cakes and the occasional quest bar. 

I swear half my intake for the past few weeks has been artificial sweeteners. I�m sick of it.
