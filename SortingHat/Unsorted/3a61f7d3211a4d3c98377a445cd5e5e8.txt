
My life as a fitness timeline
I was muscular when I was born. As a toddler I was skinny. Then as I was developing I started getting chubby. My family who are all fit and healthy and super attractive started making fun of me. This made things worse. I looked for food for comfort. One day in seventh grade I had enough and started working out. I became obsessed, the six-pack started rolling in and girls and boys started to notice me. Since I thought I was ugly because of cystic acne and other skin problems I thought the only chance I had at being accepted was via a nice body. I got the �perfect� body around sophomore year of high-school. I was so toned that I had the body fat percentage of an Olympian athlete! However this came at a cost. I was obsessed. It was so bad that if I didn�t work out for a day I would think I was getting fat. All the memories of my past and people who made fun of me would invade my mental space. I had exercise anorexia and I had it for years and years. One time I was doing the Insanity challenge and I did insanity with the flu and after I was shaking uncontrollably on the floor from all the shock I caused my body. I was unhealthily obsessed. Then in college time became a precious commodity and I slowly worked out less and less. However due to genetics I was still �in shape� according to conventional standards of the word. I still had abs just not as toned and my muscles got even bigger since building muscle is whats easiest for me. I then got mono which set me back since I was bedridden for some time. After that I was back to working out but from time to time. Then I rolled my ankle. That set me back months. Then after that I got into a relationship. He wasn�t into fitness or nutrition and we would pig out together all the time. Ordering junk food and cuddling watching Netflix was the norm. I would eat fried wings about three times a week (at least) in addition to my unhealthy college meals. I stopped caring about how I looked because I felt like the love I was receiving was enough for me. I stopped working out. I still maintained an ok body though because of genetics. Then I get mono a second time. While semi-bedridden I pigged out day and night. Eventually one day I woke up and realized that none of my jeans fit me and my shirts were way too tight but for the wrong reasons. I hated my body but I didn�t want to put all the effort that I once did to get it back. I started eating more and more having a defeatist attitude about it all. I realized (present moment) that exercise should be done because of your health and not because of vanity. It should not replace therapy or be used as the single cure for X mental problem (although fitness as a supplemental strategy is fine within reason). My goal now is to get my body back but more so to be fit and flexible and strong and healthy in the process. I also love my body. Right now I am thick. So what. I�m still me. I will get a six pack again and I will love that too. If I ever lose it again , I�d love that too. I now realize that I  should exercise because I love myself and I should care about my health. I also don�t care what people think of my body. Several mean comments have been made to me such as �you�re fat now haha�  �your glory days are over� �your one of us now� etc. These only motivate me more to stick to my goals. I now longer hate myself because of what people say and that is truly so liberating.
