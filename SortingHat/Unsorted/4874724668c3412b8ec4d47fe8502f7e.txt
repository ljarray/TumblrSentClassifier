
I just saw this popular post that made it seem like skinny people don�t have body issues. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE WITH THAT SHIT. Don�t celebrate your body confidence and put down another. You fucking literal walking contradiction. Skinny people have issues to. Don�t make it seem like body issues only occur to those that are bigger. People whom are skinny are also dealing with scrutiny as well. Don�t turn and side eye my problems just because you feel some kinda way. Its okay to say fuck skinny people, but If I say fuck fat people its a issue and I�m fat shaming. LIKE. GET. THE. FUCK. OUT. OF. HERE. Body Shaming is for all not just one dress size you fucking abomination.
