
So my sister?s fianc? is a personal trainer and he?s always making mean comments about people?s weight, but especially mine. Since I got sick I?ve gained a ton of weight (meds, too much pain to exercise, thyroid, PCOS, so many factors) and he bullies me a lot, and I already have low self esteem. But I?ve been slowly working to lose weight and it?s slowly happening.

I was venting to my mom and cousin. And my 15 year old cousin said

?Why is he so mean? Who cares what someone weighs, as long as they?re happy it doesn?t matter?

I was floored, I?m so happy that she has a kind heart, and an intelligent concept of weight at only 15. I wish I had had that then.
