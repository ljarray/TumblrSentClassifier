

This is me.

No filter, no flexing, nothing.

I don�t look like the models in the magazines or a super toned fitness model, but that is ok.
Know why? I am not a model.
And I will never be. But that is ok, because I don�t even want to.

I have wide hips. If I eat crap it lands there. Not my tummy, my thighs or my butt.
I eat a lot of healthy foods - Veggies, Fruit and the lot. 
But I don�t have a 100% discipline. I like Nutella and sweets and the occasional pizza, burger and fries.

I was unhappy looking in the mirror this morning and asked myself why. I always knew that I will never have a sixpack or massive biceps. So what is it I want?

I want to be strong. And fast. And I will be able to run longer distances but if my body doesn�t show it, who cares?
All that matters is that I know what I can do. I need to look at this body daily and accept and love what I see.

It�s really not about how I look - it�s about what I can do and how I feel on the inside.

Thank you body for hardly being sick, for healing if injured, for doing workouts.

I love you.
