
I?m dealing with body image right now. I?ve been gaining so much weight since I started college and started living on my own.

It sucks because sometimes I just feel so ugly. I see my fat rolls and how some of my clothes are starting to get too tight.. I have a boyfriend and everything, and he always says I?m beautiful but ugh. I just want to love myself.

I used to be so confident about my body but now I?m terrified of ever seeing the number on the scale. I?m starting to feel guilty about the things I eat and the exercise I don?t get.
