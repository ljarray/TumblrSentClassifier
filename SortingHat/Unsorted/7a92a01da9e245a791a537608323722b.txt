
I feel so different recently. Last night I went to the gym for the first time in over a year and I didn?t realise how much my body had changed since not going.

After a year of horrible disordered thinking, being 5ft9 and UK sizes 6/8/10 and thinking I was obese, crying all the time about how ?fat? I was while going to the gym as much as possible, I completely went the opposite way. I started binge eating, a lot, it was basically a horrible experience and took me back to my childhood when I was overweight and would binge after school.

While binging I started to feel less horrible about my body, I gained a bit of weight but didn?t mind as much as I would have whilst dieting/exercising. I?ve definitely gained more than I would have liked but now I?m just focusing on how I can change my body back to a healthy, fit state. My mindset changes as soon as I leave uni, I?m glad I?m out of that toxic situation I was in for two years, home is a much more healthy place to be.

I?m excited for what is to come and I can?t wait for the progress pictures.
