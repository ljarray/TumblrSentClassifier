
Thin Privilege
Something the fat shaming movement likes to use against thin people like me
Saying I have been so privileged my whole life by being healthy, and not overweight
Let�s take a look at what thin privilege really is

I remember being in middle school, always trying to stay home �sick� from school because all of the chubby and fat girls bullied me
I got called anorexic (despite my not so anorexic diet) on a daily basis to my face, and under other girl�s breaths
I got shoved around, pushed, kicked, hit,  and tormented
They would say how �gross� and �zombified� I looked, and say I needed �meat on my bones� if I ever wanted to get a guy
They would say I was going to be a �crazy cat lady� and the new �forty year old virgin�
They would say hurtful things, and annoy me in my classes, classes I did good in and enjoyed became a playground of torment for them to hurt me.
They would poke at my ribs, and humiliate me
They would talk about how ugly I was to boys in front of me, making sure they knew I could hear
They would tell me no one would ever love me, and call me names like �flat-chested bitch�
They would tell my friends that I was �secretly a boy�
My teachers would see this going on in the classroom, and say nothing
I cried a lot, but nobody cared except for my small group of friends who ridiculed me as well on occasion
I wanted to die
I soon got depressed, and started cutting myself
I would binge eat sometimes, and cry myself to sleep almost every night
I tried to commit suicide, and I hated everything and everyone
I wanted to die
I still struggle, to this day, 7 years later, with loving myself
I struggle with depression that puts a heavy weight on my relationship with my husband sometimes
I feel useless and powerless a lot of the time
I still sometimes have nightmares about it, and cry

So don�t you dare fucking tell me I have thin privilege, because believe me, there is no fucking privilege about being thin
I tried to put on weight, and I couldn�t
I was practically a walking skeleton for years until I got pregnant with my son
I will not be ridiculed, and yelled at for being �privileged� for being fucking thin
I had to go through hell and back with the shittiest kids I ever fucking knew whose names are still seared into my memory to this day
I remember the complete horror I felt when having a boy come up to me, and say straight to my fucking face that bony was ugly, and no one would probably ever love me
Don�t try and shove that PC shit down my throat, or I will release hell on you because you know what?
I went through that fucking hell once in my life, I�m not going to take it and go through it again
So fuck you, and your �thin privilege� bullshit.
I will not be silent while you try to shove your hate agenda down my throat
Don�t get me wrong, I�m not saying all fat shaming people are like this, but you know damn well a good amount are

Don�t harass me for being thin and choosing a healthy lifestyle my mother encouraged for me at a young age (we were pretty broke growing up, but she still encouraged being healthy) I�m not harassing you for choosing to eat an insane amount of food everyday and not exercise.
