
Need some advice on macros
Currently Im burning about 450-600 cals a day and eating 1500 (not including veggies which I don�t log) 
I�ve been hitting my macros perfectly 
120 protein/50 fat/150 carbs 
However when swim season starts I�ll probably be burning 500-2000 because I�ll be swimming two hours everyday, weight lifting for an hour and doing a half hour of running 
How should I increase my macros but still loose weight? Last swim season I gained 20 pounds and I�d really like to lose that and get super toned! I have the perfect opportunity 
If anyone has a good idea about macros please let me know! I�d love some advice
