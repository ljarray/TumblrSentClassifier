
Five Day
Tried the body pump class at the Y
I toughed it out the entire hour
Every muscle in my body is making sure I am aware they exist today.

I am so proud of my daughter right now, she just received a promotion at work spins exactly what she has been working towards

My boss put me in my place today . I asked for help and he said no, figure it out. Damn

watadad yelled at me yesterday to stop putting myself down. I liked that.

My kids have really wasted their summer this year . I need to schedule time off next year for sure
