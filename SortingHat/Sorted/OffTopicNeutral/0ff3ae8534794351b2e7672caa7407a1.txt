
daydreaming about the oatmeal i had for breakfast.

it was pretty damn good.

but i can look forward to the banana nice cream i�m going to have for dinner! 

it can be a bit of a nuisance when i have to take the time to prepare my meals, but i�m losing the taste for processed and unhealthy foods that i had before, already! i�m so happy about that! it doesn�t help that the processed vegan cheese i had again for lunch (i made more mini pizzas, lol) made me feel sick. so now i�m currently associated all those processed foods and all junk food with feeling sick.

why i didn�t do that before when those foods made me feel sick before, i don�t know, but it�s working now.

now i want to get rid of my love affair with salt. i mean, a little is fine, but i feel like i�ve been eating too much salt and that may be causing bloating.

that or i�m pmsing. if i have my period soon, i�ll understand. heh.

#health#diet#clean eating#hopefully this lasts! :D
