
Baked Avocado with Chilli and Cheese

A superb accompaniment to a salad, meat, or fish dish, or great on its own as a starter.

Ingredients:

1 avocado
100g cheddar
1 chilli
Pre heat the oven to about 170 degrees. Prepare your avocado by cutting it in half and removing the stone. Spoon out the filling and place into a bowl. Grate the cheddar and finely chop the chilli. Add these and mix together with the avocado well. Spoon the mix back into the avocados and place on a baking tray and into the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes until the cheese looks grilled. Drizzle some oil on top to serve, I would recommend an olive oil infused with chilli, or for that extra oriental taste, toasted sesame oil.
