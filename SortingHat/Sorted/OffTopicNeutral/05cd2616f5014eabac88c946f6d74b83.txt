You will need a microwave and a fridge for this one!


It comes with face shaped cookies that taste like pocky, milk/white chocolate, banana flavor powder, and a frosting bag (which I didn�t use):


Pour the chocolate into the containers that remind of those sauce containers at McDonalds.


Microwave! It actually took about 2:30 for both of them to be completely melted!


Pour chocolate into mold.


I mixed the banana flavor powder with the white chocolate to make it yellow!


I used a toothpick to make the swirls!


I put the face shaped cookies onto the molds and put them into the fridge for a few minutes.


They are easy to pop out without cracking!


The molds also had faces!


Taste test:

This taste a lot like pocky. The chocolate didn�t taste like standard chocolate in America. It tasted more swiss/japanese, there is less cocoa flavor to it. The milk chocolate tasted sweet and milky, not like cocoa. The white chocolate tasted even more like cream.

The banana flavor powder tastes like sweet artificial banana. I used to collect sanrio scented erasers back in elementary school, and it taste exactly like how the banana one smells.

It melts quickly on a warm summer�s day. In fact, it started melting as I held it in my hand to take a picture!


On the package, there are only english ingredients for the cookie. The cookie is made of wheat flour, shortening, sugar, vegetable oil, lactose, egg, dextrin, cacao mass, whole milk powder, butter, margarine, sweetened condensed milk powder, salt, cocoa powder, defatted (that�s a word?) milk powder, baking power, citric acid, and water.

I got this for around $3 at Marukai!
