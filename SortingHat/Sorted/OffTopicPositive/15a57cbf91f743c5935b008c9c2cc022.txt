
you inspire me
It�s hard to eat right. I�ve never had a healthy diet. I was raised on fry bread and spam sandwiches. I�ve never had an active lifestyle. I blamed my inactivity on my asthma and clumsiness. 
Now that I�ve finally had enough of feeling sluggish, tired, and just plain lazy, I�m not only training my body, but training my mind to continue when I�m ready to give up�. And I must say, this little healthy tumblr community has really kept me motivated. I�m inspired daily with all the reminders that there are people out there who don�t even know me and want me to succeed. Hopefully all the shit I reblog inspires you too� and no matter how far along you are on your journey, just know that I believe in you and want you to succeed. Let�s be healthy and happy together!
