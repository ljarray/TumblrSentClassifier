

Ive been taking pictures of myself in weird bathrooms. I dont like taking selfies and even on my fb i dont have pictures of myself, but ive been really down lately. I have to remind myself that I am strong and that I am a beautiful woman. Itï¿½s always nice to catch myself in mirrors and remember that this is a beautiful body and what gives it life is beautiful too. Love yourself everyone. Be kind to yourself and bask in your radiance.
