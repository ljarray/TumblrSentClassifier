
think of it this way: every soul is a star of the sky and we all shine a little differently. some are bigger, some are smaller, some are famous & have names that are more known, some tend to burn so bright they fall, but while sitting on a cemented driveway with craning necks towards the vast inky night above, youï¿½ll find that our existence together creates a shimmering sight. and we are all part of that masterpiece. you are in a beautiful story because you exist in it. you matter, you are a part of something greater, simply because you are here.
