
Chia seed pudding!
This is a staple for me at the moment. Chia seed pudding is SO easy to make and prepare, and the health benefits are out of this world!

Chia seeds have almost zero net carbs due to its high fibre content, are full of good fats and protein, and have lots of Omega 3s! It�s a keto-ers dream food. I love Chia pudding because you can do anything with it. The below is a staple recipe I used (found on Pinterest), but you can add various flavourings to it. I love mine with sugar free maple syrup, or add some cocoa powder to it, or vanilla essence. For people not on Keto, or a bit more lenient with their carbs, it�s amazing topped with some berries. 

Once you�ve combined the ingredients, let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours to set. I make mine with almond milk and the nutty taste is just so yummy!
