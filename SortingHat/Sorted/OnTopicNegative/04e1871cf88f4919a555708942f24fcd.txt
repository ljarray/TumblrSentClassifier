
What I don?t understand, and what I do not like about this generation is, you if love yourself you?re considered ?selfish? ?conceded? but if you hate yourself you?re considered an ?attention seeker? or ?asking for attention.? I don?t care what you call me, but I hate myself, I?m too fat, not pretty enough, not good enough, not smart enough, I?m just not enough. I can name so many bad things about myself before you can name one you like. That?s what I hate about how judgemental, and cruel this generation has become. Someone told me that no ones gonna love you until you learn to love yourself, and that?s the shittiest piece of advice I?ve ever got. I found someone who loves my body, my laugh, my smile, my stupid comments. That person loves me for me, and I couldn?t thank them enough for being by my side.
