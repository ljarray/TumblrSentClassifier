Body image. 
Skinny. The word that has been used by so many people. They desire to be skinny they think they?re too fat, but there even if ur skinny u can still feel bad about urself. I have always been skinny I remember when I was a child I would cry my eyes out bc clothes that would fit normal kids didn?t fit me. People told I wish I was as skinny as u, your so lucky and I told them u don?t wan to be skinny. Until this day I try to gain weight and I can?t I try to eat healthy and then people say u have to more food and but some meat on your bones. I always felt like shit and I still do. Now as I?m getting older, 16 years old and on lying weighing 92 pounds I still feel like crap. I try in clothes and they don?t fit shorts size double 00 fit weird. I feel like guys won?t look at me bc the standards of girl is not me and its fucked up. I just don?t no it?s something that isn?t important but it?s the way I feel and I can tell u that skinny people go through the same body image issues as other people.
