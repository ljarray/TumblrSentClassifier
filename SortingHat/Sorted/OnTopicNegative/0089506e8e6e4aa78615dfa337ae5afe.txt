
I think a lot about how I am too thin to be plus size and too fat to be skinny and how I really dislike being in that gap of laziness where my body is basically telling me that if I made any effort, healthy or unhealthy, I could probably get thinner but instead I keep eating mac and cheese at 2am and then feeling guilty about it.

Also that there?s a ton of pride for larger feminine people but I don?t feel large enough to be a part of that group so I?m just kind of? Chubby? Average?
