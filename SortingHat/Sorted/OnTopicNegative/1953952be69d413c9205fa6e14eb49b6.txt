
i get very annoyed when people say that skinny shaming isn�t real;

i�ve had years of people telling me i don�t look like a person, people constantly commenting on my body and telling me it�s not good enough -  i�ve also been made feel guilty about my body because i�ve had people tell me i am the reason they are self concious about their body/want to loose weight

skinny shaming has caused me anxiety about wearing what i want and being who i want.
