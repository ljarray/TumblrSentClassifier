O1. WATER! I know I say this every day but it�s seriously so important� Drink water all day long! If you drink ice cold water then your body has to work harder to warm you up, using fat already stored on you. If you have hunger pangs, drink warm water. It�s known to help settle a hungry rumbling tummy.

O2. STOP DRINKING YOUR CALORIES! If you�re thirsty drink water (I know I�m a broken record). You�d be surprised at how many extra calories you�re ingesting by drinking pops and juices. Not only will it lower your calorie intake but water is just better for your body.

O3. ADD LEMON TO YOUR WATER! Citrus fruits, like lemons, help to burn fat quicker. So add a couple slices of lemon to your water bottle before leaving the house.

O4. START TAKING VITAMINS! I mean all of them. Studies have shown that people tend to seek out certain foods that contain the nutrients they are lacking. Because your lacking you end up bingeing,which is never good. Make sure your body is getting all the nutrients it needs and that means less binge eating for you! At the very least, start taking a daily multivitamin.

O5. SLEEP IN THE DARKEST DARK! Studies have shown that turning out all the lights (hall lights, TV screens, night lights etc) leaves you less likely to midnight munch. People who sleep with the tv turned on etc, tend to eat at odd hours. AND you have less self control, when you get up from sleeping, for a snack.

O6. GREEN TEA helps to boost your metabolism. And who doesn�t love tea, right?

O7. PEPPERMINT is known to help curb your hunger! If you chew gum (sugar free only beauties!) go for peppermint. Wanna take it to the next level? Chew on the actual peppermint leaves (don�t swallow) or put it in your water to help keep those hunger pains at bay.

O8. INCLUDE FIBER IN YOUR DIET! Fiber makes you feel full faster, and takes fat out of the body with it! Also it�s good for you, and has many added health benefits.

That�s all for today beauties! Send me an ask if you want more ??k x
