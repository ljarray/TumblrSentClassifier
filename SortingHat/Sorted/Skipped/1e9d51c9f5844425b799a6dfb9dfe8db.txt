
Why Does My Size Concern You?
Don?t say it?s because of health. Don?t you dare. If it was because of health you would be shaming the skinny kids who eat nothing but junk food. You would be shaming the people who starve themselves. But no, you shame OBESE people. As an obese girl, I have experienced so many people telling me what I should be doing so that I am more visually appealing to them. My health is not on the mind when someone tells me to stick my fingers down my throat. My health is of no concern when girls giggle at me and call me names. Why does my weight concern anyone else? Why does it matter if I?m fat to you? I?m unpleasant to look at? Boohoo. Let me deal with my own body. It?s my business if I want to change or stay the way I am. Get your health bullshit away from me.
