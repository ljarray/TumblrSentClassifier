
IMPORTANT AF PLEASE READ
Hey, I�m Brooke. I know I don�t have a lot of followers but this is so so so important to me and my friends so I want all of you to spread this as much as you can. Recently we came across a website called  www.skinnygossip.com . On this invite-only website there are articles and forum posts filled with hate towards people who aren�t skinny, even some who are very skinny but called �overweight� and other horrible things. Some of the people haven�t said anything offensive from what we�ve seen but a lot are very hateful.

By now we should all know that words are so powerful you could change someone�s life or even end it, with just one sentence. So many men, women, boys and girls have committed suicide because of people like this and it�s very important that we do something about this website and other similar websites. If we can�t stop this website I�d still like to say we tried, I want to say that we worked together and tried our best but in the end we couldn�t do it. If we can I will be overjoyed that me and my friend that wishes to remain anonymous�s words can change something and possibly save someone�s life. If you can�t do anything to help please just stay away from this website. 

In 2012 a lot of people heard about a user calling Kate Upton fat and there are a few videos on YouTube addressing the issue. YouTube channels such as SourceFed, AskMen & blingqueen45 have made videos talking about it and they all seemed to think that Kate was not fat at all.

This is a quote for one of my best friends who wants her identity kept a secret for personal reasons:

�Imagine a young girl, of a perfectly healthy weight, suddenly finding herself on a website. The website is called skinnygossip.com. Not knowing what she�s in for, she scrolls through the articles reading the ones that catch her eye. By the time she shuts down the computer she has already looked in the mirror more than a dozen times. She�s rolling off the diet tips in her head. The insults are closing in on her. She�s prodding at her stomach trying to make the perfectly normal bulges disappear. Words are so meaningful, so powerful. On skinnygossip.com words are used in a way that will have so much negative effects on the people who read them. This website shames bodies. It shames women. It shames us. All for the sake of a few people feeling better about themselves because they can fall into a class of bodies that we would call skinny. It attacks women that aren�t supermodel skinny and it attacks models who have put on �too much weight�. The language used is disgusting. It acts as if a fat roll is going to be the end of the world. This site only does not shame perfectly normal bodies but it promotes unhealthy obsessions with being skinny and having an unhealhy body. Some people are naturally skinny, some people are naturally heavy and some people are naturally that medium which we call average. We can do exercise to mantain the healthy bodies that we can feel confident and beautiful in but we should not starve ourselves and be so cruel to ourselves that we feel tired and yes, perhaps, beautiful. But is it worth it? What�s wrong with having excess fat, dark hairs under your armpits, being hairy? We give ourselves standards and society as a whole develops standards. If you want to be something you must follow this, that and the other. Even subcultures can have specific standards that to be part of that particular subculture you must follow rules or else you are a �phony�.   So we set ourselves standards. When we are dealing with our bodies sometimes we set our standards too high. Skinnygossip.com is implying that this is a good thing. That anything is worth it to be skinny and being fat is like a work of evil. I believe this site should be shut down because of how it is badly affecting the people who read it. Take myself, for example, I�m 13 and i�m underweight for my age, this is due to medical reasons of which i will not state, and after about 5 minutes of being on this website, which i can only describe as hideous, i felt like i wanted to cry. Like i needed to reach out to the people they are insulting and give them a hug. I want them to know that if they are healthy they should be happy with themselves. I want them to know that there are people looking out for them. I want them to know that this average or these standards are not reality for everybody. The people on skinnygossip.com need to stop and we need to show them as a society that they must.�
