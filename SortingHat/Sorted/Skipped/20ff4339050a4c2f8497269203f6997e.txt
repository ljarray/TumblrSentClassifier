
Today sucked, I ate WAY too little. But there's really nothing I can do while I'm at work ):
Breakfast-
Two glasses of lemonade, two eggs over easy, country potatoes, saut�ed green bell peppers and onions and cheddar cheese. (Went to Dennys ??)

Snack-
� cup of raw almonds, half an apple, kale bar (kale, dried fruit, dates, and dark chocolate)

Later snack-
Two handfuls of trail mix, 12 oz of water, another kale bar, and a piece of wheat bread with a tbsp of peanut butter and some cinnamon.

I reallllly need to figure out how to eat at work. 
There will probably be an update later, cause I AM gonna eat more. This is ridiculous.
