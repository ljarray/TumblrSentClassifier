
I love my protruding hipbones, my vibrant blue veins, my lightning stretchmarks on my hips. I love my soft upper arm skin, and my defined upper arm muscle. I love my broad shoulders and my wide hips. I love my strong legs, my bold, wide stature. I love my pudge wherever it may fall. I love the tiny hills and valleys that make up the surface of my thighs. I love the sound of my thighs smacking together when I run without pants on. I love my small breasts and ass to make up for them, that little spot above the thigh crease that?s perfect for pinching. I love my skin, eager to form goosebumps at the most gentle touch. I love the little birthmark on my shoulder and the dark mole on my thigh. I love the patch of scar tissue on my ankle from that tricycle accident. I love my abnormal jaw structure and pointed nose.

I love how my body reflects my experiences, contextualizing my past as it was.

I love how its genetics reflects the millenia of evolution behind my existence being possible.

I really, really love my body.
personally, superficially, practically, cosmically
