
I?m rested and back home and I feel inspired. 

I?m going to be starting a new segment on my youtube channel, MattJosephDiaz, where I tackle different aspects and things that make us insecure about our bodies. Each episode I?ll strive to inform people about these aspects of ourselves, break down the myths surrounding them and talk about why we shouldn?t let them make us feel self conscious.

This week, we?ll discuss stretch marks.

If you have any points about stretch marks you?d like me to discuss, any rumors you want me to tackle or even ideas for future topics, please let me know!

Together we?ll help build a positive self-image for people all over the world, one piece at a time.
