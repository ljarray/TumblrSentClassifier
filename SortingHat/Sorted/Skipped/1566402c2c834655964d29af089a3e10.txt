
People really struggle with body image because society tells us we need to look a certain way & if we don?t we?re less than ?? I?ve hated myself for so long because I didn?t look like the girls in the magazines & music videos but I?ve learned to love myself & try to put out positive vibes out in the world because everyone should love the skin their in & know their worth!
