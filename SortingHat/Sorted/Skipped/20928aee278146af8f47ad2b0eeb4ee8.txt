
I did my weigh-in today!
I�m at 141.4 lbs and 21.7% body fat. 

I don�t care so much about the weight, but my goal is 20% body fat. So I�m down from my last weigh-in, which was 143.7 lbs/22.4%!

Now I just need to keep that up and focus on eating properly. Abs are made in the kitchen! Anyone have tips for a pescetarian with an allergy to peanuts and tree nuts?
