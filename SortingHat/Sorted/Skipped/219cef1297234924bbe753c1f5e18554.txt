
I see a lot of body positive posts for women and I think that?s amazing, but I just wanna give a s/o to all my boys out there with unconventional bodies. It doesn?t matter if you feel too skinny or too big or like you don?t have enough muscle or they say you?re too short. Don?t feel like you?re any less attractive to girls/other boys/literally anyone just because your body isn?t like the ones you see in the superhero movies and the magazines. I?ve been there, I?m still there sometimes. I get you. I love you.
