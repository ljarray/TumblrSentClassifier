
Day 33: beware exhaustion
I worked all day today and I�m literally to winks from falling fast asleep.

My summer job is anything but glamorous because all I do is sit on my ass and take money for tickets at a high school baseball tournaments. So I was sitting in the sun all day today (I have the tab lines to prove it).

And even though I was doing basically nothing, being in the sun drained all of my energy. When I got home I went to the gym thinking I�d be fine, but once I go there and started working out, I felt how tired I was and I couldn�t really focus and I just remember someone somewhere telling me to not push yourself when you are exhausted because nothing good will come out of it.

So I came home and now I�m writing this. Don�t work out when your are too tired to process anything.

In other news, I talked to the hot guy who works the front desk. I just wish I didn�t look like death and wasn�t breathing so heavy.

A turkey bacon and egg white sandwich
An iced vanilla coffee

I really hope you all had a wonderful day! Let me know how it went!

Love, Jenna ??
