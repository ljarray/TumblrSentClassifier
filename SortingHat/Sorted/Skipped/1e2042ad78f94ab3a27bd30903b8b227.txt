
8 reasons women's magazines are bad for your health

Flat abs fast! Hot body now! Here?s why you should (almost) never believe health advice in fashion magazines.

1) You won?t achieve a healthy weight through buying a particular product or going on a crash diet.

2) You don?t need to be super strict about your diet.

3) Exercise doesn?t have to be annoying or overly complex.

4) Celebrities aren?t good sources of health information.

5) Expensive creams and potions won?t make you more beautiful.

6) You shouldn?t aspire to look like Kim Kardashian. Not even she looked like Kim Kardashian without a lot of help.

7) Smoking isn?t glamorous.

8) Unless you?re a heroin addict, you probably don?t need to detox.
