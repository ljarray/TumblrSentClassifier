if you?re ?overweight? I would LOVE to know what I?m considered, haha. like I don?t care at all but the term overweight gets thrown around and what does it even MEAN, over what incredibly low weight???

BMI is literally just an estimate of your body fat based on your height in correlation to your weight. So I?m 5?4? and weigh 155 lbs so according to the BMI scale I have more body fat than is considered healthy for my height. If I actually do is a different story. For a ?healthy? amount of body fat I should be around 122 lbs.

But let me tell you something. The last time I was 120 lbs. I was anorexic and bulimic and I looked fucking awful so that?s why BMIs don?t mean shit to me. They don?t take into account muscle mass or excess skin (for those who?ve lost weight quickly) or whether you had an eating disorder in the past and now you?re at an actually healthy weight?

They are soulless tools used to gauge ?health? in an arguably inaccurate way so like I truly could not give a shit lmao
