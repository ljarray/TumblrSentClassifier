
Posting Thinspo is WRONG #1
You are stealing someone�s photo.

Just because you found it is not an excuse to post it. You are violating their autonomy and possibly their privacy by posting photos of others without their permission.

Many of these photos are stolen from private chatrooms, private instagrams, personal snapchats, private message boards, and even Facebook and YouTube. They were never meant to be public.

It�s incredibly creepy of you to keep spreading them.
