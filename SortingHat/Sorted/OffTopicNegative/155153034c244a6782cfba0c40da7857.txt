
Here is the trouble with the term �clean eating� � presupposes the opposite, which would be �dirty eating� i.e. junk food, fast food, etc. It has classist undertones (overtones really, imo), due to the lack of availability of fresh food in food deserts (google this term if you wish to learn more�it�s really important and I�m a first time tumblr rant-er and don�t really know how to do sources). Long story short�don�t call people�s food �dirty�. It�s rude, you know?
