
Cows and pigs deserve to be slaughtered because they�re uglier than dogs and cats
I understand that veganism is a hard concept for some people to wrap their heads around. It was hard for me at first too. However, some people are SO adamant that consuming meat and dairy is healthy and ethical that they go to ridiculous lengths to try and convince others of that. If you are a current meat eater, I�m not trying to throw every single one of you under the bus. Just please take a walk in my shoes for two minutes, and think about how illogical this reasoning sounds.

I had a friend, about a week ago, call me vegan mockingly. I�ve gotten to the point where this happens so much, it doesn�t really phase me anymore. I know that the friends who do this don�t actually mean it in a negative way, they�re just confused and looking for something to cover up their guilt. Anyway, I decided this time to counter with �well you don�t eat your dog, why do you eat cows?� And what she said next made me question the integrity and mindset of the entire human race. �Well, cows are ugly, so I can eat them.� I immediately freaked the fuck out. How can someone make it okay in their mind that they should slaughter and eat an animal because it IS UGLIER THAN ANOTHER??? Do UGLIER people deserve to be killed too?? That�s the only way it would make sense. Just because cows have hooves instead of paws and live in a different habitat MEANS THEY DESERVE TO DIE?? Because of you�re incredible selfishness and prejudices, CERTAIN ANIMALS ARE OKAY TO SHOOT DEAD, SKIN, COOK, AND SHOVE INTO YOUR BODY AND SOME ARE NOT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????

The fact is that it�s the norm to eat cows, pigs, and chickens and not dogs, cats, and horses. Is it really because they�re uglier? I don�t think so. But I was SHOCKED at the lengths people would go to to support something that obviously doesn�t make sense. It shows how uneducated most people are on the topic, and that they are quite literally brainwashed.

Another fact: ALL animals WANT to live. Wow, who would�ve thought. Animals other than house pets should have the right to be alive? Another life form with a brain (just like you) has a DESIRE to stay alive, to produce offspring that will thrive and live happily just like their parents did? 

Just because animals can�t communicate with humans doesn�t mean they don�t feel. And just because humans are �the superior being� and build skyscrapers and cars doesn�t mean that we get to kill other animals for our own selfish reasons.

In this day and age, humans don�t have to eat meat anymore, period. We�re far beyond that. We�re not hunters and gatherers wandering through the forest looking for everything and anything to eat anymore. We�re also not carnivores, who thrive on other animals and need it to survive. Even the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Earth�s deadliest carnivore who needed to eat meat, didn�t discriminate what it ate and what it didn�t because of how cute it was.

See how ridiculous it sounds now?

Yes, humans are the most advanced animals currently living on Earth. Does that mean some other animals deserve to be killed by us. No. Does that mean we get to judge animals on how they look and chew on the ones that are less appealing? No. Does that mean just because we CAN make a profit on selling animal corpses and bodily fluids, we have to or should? No.
