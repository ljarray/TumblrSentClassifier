
fun fact the strongest people in the world are large and chunky and fat

look at people who do caber toss, who lift in excess of 1,000 pounds, who do those plane tows and stuff

they?re muscular but they?ve got a pretty decent amount of fat on them too

you gotta be an endomorph to be that strong

#'all fat people are lazy and out of shape' get outta my face#plenty of us are and we deserve just as much respect as fat athletes#but don't go pretending fat athletes don't exist either#gently screams#boring text posts#body image
