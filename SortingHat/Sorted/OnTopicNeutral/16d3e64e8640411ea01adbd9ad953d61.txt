
Just found photos of me from like a couple of years ago (when I thought I was fat Hahahahahhahaha) and I honestly feel like crying. I?d kill to look like that again. My body was perfect smooth curves, honestly, not bump or rolls of fat at my waist. It was a perfect smooth hourglass?.. And now I look like a fat lump and omg, I need to print out that photo and hang it on my mirror as daily inspiration.
