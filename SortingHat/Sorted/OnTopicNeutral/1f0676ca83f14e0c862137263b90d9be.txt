
Sometimes i see skinny people being body positive and I think mean things like ?oh yeah well it?s easy to love your body when it?s perfect.?

And then I think about my thin friends I?ve spent hours upon hours trying to convince them that their bodies are rad.

I think of my thin friends with eating disorders.

I think of my thin friends who are made fun of for their bodies.

Hell, i think of myself. I?m not exactly ?skinny? and I don?t have a flat stomach, but my body is pretty nice and there?s no reason for me to hate it so much. But I still find a reason.

And thats the thing:

Everybody has the capacity to struggle with their body image.

Everybody has the right to be proud of and excited about their body positivity.

We?re all just people trying to make it through this life and feel beautiful along the way.
