Click here to read from the beginning of my journey

My husband and I just watched the documentary Fed Up Even though I pretty much had read or heard most of the information before sitting there watching it I felt as if it were the first time that I was hearing it and I just felt appalled as I watched But I also felt a bit of satisfaction that it pretty much lines up with where I am right now in my health and fitness If you havent watched it I highly recommend that you do Basically it focuses on our obesity epidemic which started in the 1970s and 1980s at the same time that we started to become more healthconscious and produce diet food It also focuses a lot on sugar and how addictive it is I really felt for these kids that they focused on who were so heavy and you can just feel the defeat they feel It really is very sad 



So for me that just renews my commitment to my fitness journey And focusing on my nutrition as much as I focus on my workouts 
Im almost finished with my PiYo program That makes me excited that I will be able to say that I finished it But my journey is not over The next leg of my journey is P90X3 When I first started this my coach told me that Id probably see more progress with P90X3 than with PiYo I still chose PiYo though because I knew that I needed something that I would be able to stick to Now that I will have finished it I have no worries about finishing P90X3 But you can keep following to see for sure



As for my weight loss Ive lost another pound so Im at a total of 14 pounds in 9 weeks That averages to a pound and a half a week All it has taken is some consistency and determination And support from my challenge groups and the team of coaches that I am involved with
