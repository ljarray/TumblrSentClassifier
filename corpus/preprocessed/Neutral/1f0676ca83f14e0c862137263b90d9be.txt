
Sometimes i see skinny people being body positive and I think mean things like oh yeah well its easy to love your body when its perfect

And then I think about my thin friends Ive spent hours upon hours trying to convince them that their bodies are rad

I think of my thin friends with eating disorders

I think of my thin friends who are made fun of for their bodies

Hell i think of myself Im not exactly skinny and I dont have a flat stomach but my body is pretty nice and theres no reason for me to hate it so much But I still find a reason

And thats the thing

Everybody has the capacity to struggle with their body image

Everybody has the right to be proud of and excited about their body positivity

Were all just people trying to make it through this life and feel beautiful along the way

 body image body postivity mental health self love
