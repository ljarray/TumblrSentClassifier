
Purples Blues and You
One of the great things about getting older and wiser is realizing what fashionwise works for youand what never will

I spent all of my teens and most of my 20s trying on things buying things and cursing my neck my thighs my waist my calves for not being the right size and shape I vowed to eat less do more push ups wear a jacket get a tan 

LookI will probably never look good in high collars fleshtones ankle boots strapless dresses But I can rock plaid Doc Martens off the shoulder sweaters and YELLOW like nobodys business Ive got great collarbones stormy eyes soft skin warrior princess legs and I can blog you into whatever emotion I see fit


When I go shopping now I dont paw at bodycon dresses wishing my midsection looked less I swallowed a partially damaged Amazon Prime boxaint nobody got time for that I look for lower necklines Black grey blues purples polka dots houndstooth Pieces that allow me to sit pretzellegged to be confident in grand gestures to walk faster than average

Ive seen myself in pictures in mirrors on camera on the Internetthe research has been done Mistakes have been made I know what a great me looks likedestressed wellrested hydrated informedand Im wise enough to know the steps it takes to get there I know my cuts my colorsand thats not to say Ill never try anything elsebut it IS to say that when I do try those notme things and they are definitively not me I wont be destroyed I wont assemble an internal siege I will not regress to juniorhigh me plaintively picking at a plain bagel an hour and a half before a sixmile run


I know more now

And so do you
So stop pretending
