
Im really beautiful Im gonna try really hard to keep reframing the way I see myself in the mirror and in photos Its really hard because Im still dealing with general body image issues that Ive always had but especially hard because I really dont want to see myself and my body as a man but its been really interesting to try really reframing it myself 

Like so far in my personal transition its been about me reframing my role in society and my actions and my presentation as notaman and recently trying to see that as a woman but I havent really tried to really reframe my body as it is Not that Im totally closing my options off to maybe doing HRT some day the thought really excites me but also doesnt seem like it might be what I ultimately want but I think I can do a lot of positive changes for myself by reframing the way that I look at my body right now Every part of it Individually just looking at parts of my body and my body as a whole as gendered in the way that I want it to be Its so interesting to do that
