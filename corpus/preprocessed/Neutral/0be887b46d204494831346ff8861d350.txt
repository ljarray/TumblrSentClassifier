
I feel like this thing happens sometimes when we think something about us is ugly we kind of try not to notice it We glance at it and instead of seeing the thing itself we sort of just have a vague filler ugly there We dont see it we see the idea of ugliness

I genuinely think that looking at the parts of you you dont like as often as possible with a concerted effort to see their beauty in an artistic sense can be a super useful tool in learning to love yourself and your body You cant love a part of yourself you try to deny exists 

 self care body image body positivity self love mine
