
we gotta start differentiating between plus size and fat models because the industry doesnt and just thinks a size eight is representation we should all praise them for

visually politically and supportively theres obviously a huge difference between a size 8 model and a size 22 model we gotta hold these companies responsible for the image they insist on promoting we cant give them credit for being representative of all bodies when they do the least possible to get the accolades they want in this case using plus size models to represent body diversity

thats not to say a size eight woman doesnt deserve that job or to be included but if we dont demand they do better then they have no reason to do so

 cleaning out my drafts body positive advertising advertising body image idk how else to tag this tbqfh tho i will ad that more models who arent able bodied and white would be aces
