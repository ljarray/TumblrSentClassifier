
My body image is so weird cuz I go 0 to 100 and all the way back to 0 real quick tbh like this afternoon nothing fit right when I was shopping and even tho I wasnt planning on buying anything it was really discouraging and made me feel kinda shitty but then later this afternoon I tried on this bralette from my friend and I loved it and felt incredible and took probably a million photos cuz I was crazy confident and its weird and I dont get it

 about me personal body image
