
Its Tuesday and I am properly hydrated

For the first time in about a week and a half Im also going to work out this afternoon like an actual proper cardio workout for the first time in about two weeks and I am absolutely probably going to die Id gotten a bit offtrack witheverything but in a way I think its been beneficial Now that I know what it feels like to actually live within my calorie goals and doing regular work outs Im so much more aware of how different it feels when Im not watching what I eat as much and letting myself be lazy for a while and I really dont like it Ive got so much less energy but more nervous energy and I feel more jammed up and foggy mentally and physically I can actually feel myself getting weaker and my body falling back into its habits of not moving and not working and not being active and awake So Im pretty excited to get back into things

Not that excited to die on this run today but excited for all the rest of it

Ive got my physical coming up in a couple of weeks on my birthday Why did I do that to myself and I think Im going to talk to my doctor about my anxiety and depression I havent actually talked to a professional since college but its getting to the point that I think I at least need some kind of advice or information Handling it on my own is starting to take over a lot of my life and its starting to actively make it difficult for me to do the things I want and have to do and if theres better ways of living with it Id definitely like to hear about them

Happy Tuesday yall Remember to drink water say hello to your pets and text somebody you like today
