
A New Start
So heres the official start of my blogging about my weight loss journey Ive been wanting to do one for a while to be honest as a way to record my journey both highs and lows  I want to have a detailed account of my journey to healthiness and eventual happiness I also hope to inspire other people to get on their own journey to better health  

Im 22 years old and Ive always been fat Not saying that as a negative thing but its true My highest weight ever was somewhere between 245 and 250 I was big lethargic and basically miserable Eating and Sleeping were my phases I was like a bear  About 2 years ago I started the whole process of losing weight and within a year I lost 50 lbs I just broke up with a crappy boyfriend and finally decided to get my ass into shape Unfortunately I relapsed got a new boyfriend Much better than the old and justgave up He made me feel as if I didnt need to lose weight anymore I got back into my old habits and regained up to 35 lbs  About 2 months ago According to MFP anyway 60215 I weighed in at 235 I was shocked I knew I had been gaining weight but I had no idea it was that bad So since then Ive decided to take a more permanent approach to weight loss I am exercising a few times a week and Im tracking the foods I eat more often and allowing for 2 cheat days While still holding myself accountable on those days and I want to take the slow and steady route to avoid relapse again
