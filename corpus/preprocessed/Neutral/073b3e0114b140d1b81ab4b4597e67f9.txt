
Just put on my first incontinence pad
And its so much thicker than I expected and I just feel like Im wearing a diaper Ive not worn pads for years as I used menstrual cups but it seems that incontinence ones are way thicker anyway Its just not helping my self esteem much I wish  incontinencepride was a thing I want confident self assured people who leak and feel okay about it to look up to

Cause Im 22 and everything I see in the media or social media about people my age is everything Im not The people I can actually identify with 60 year old women
