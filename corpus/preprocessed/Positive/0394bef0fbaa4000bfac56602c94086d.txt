
Another mental note

You are on vacation

It is okay to eat

It is okay to not be incredibly strict with your calorie consumption

It is okay to have drinks with your friends

It is okay to desire dessert after a savory meal

It is okay to fill your belly up until you are satisfied

It is okay if you go over that point into the territory of a food coma

It is okay to not go to bed convincing yourself that you arent hungry despite undereating the entire day

You wont lose control

You wont give in

You are stronger than you know
