I was trying to convince myself that I didnt need abs that I was perfectly ok with the body I have and I dont need to go crazy But that would be a lie I want to keep continually working on my body to improve it not out of hatred but because I love seeing what it can do I cant give up just because its that time of the month My goal is to see visible abs and weigh around nine and a half stone I think I can do it
