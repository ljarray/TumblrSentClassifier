
Its like this my body
Its 530 in the morning here and Im about to get ready to go out and run but first I just wanted to say that last night I had a slight epiphany  I was outside on the balcony with husband drinking cocktails and scrolling through tumblr because the wifi isnt so slow after 9pm at the hotel and I saw a post about different bodies and different swimwear  I showed him and asked who I looked like of the several women  To my shock he pointed to someone I assumed looked completely normal  I mean to say if I had seen this person around the pool in a bikini2piece I would never have even given a second glance  Id probably think Wow you look great and what an awesome swimsuit  If someone who looked exactly like me walked past me I would never think anything negative or hurtful  Id probably think they looked good  But why should any of this even matter  I dont care what others look like so why do I struggle with my own image  Why the hell at 30 years old I still care what I look like is just stupid The fact that I even had to ask him to make a comparison is just ridiculous  He always cringes and always tries to avoid bodyweightrelated questions I have about myself  Now I get it

Two days ago I caught my bikinireflection outside  I said You know what I dont look as big as I think I do  He started to clap and said Congratulations duh  Congratulations on seeing what the rest of us see  Then I knew it  I got it  I saw it  Since then Ive been walking around the pool and the beach in my bikinis and not even caring  When I saw some proofs come back from our photography and I saw my body I thought Is that really me  Am I that big  The answer is yes  This is what I look like  I have got to quit trying to be someone that isnt genuinely me

Ive weighed between 7375kg these past 3 years someone less sometimes more but so what  These numbers dont mean anything to my friends my coworkers and my family  They dont mean shit  These 7375kg allow me to work 14 hour days allow me to run and lift longer and harder and they allow me to get from A to B without struggle  Im slightly crying when I say this  I am happy to have my body
