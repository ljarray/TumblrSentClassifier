I also wanted to share that the past week Ive had so much love for myself and my body I look in the mirror and actually like what I see I used to hate on myself a lot but eating whole foods and exercising has boosted my confidence so much  Sending you loves happy and positive vibes 

 I know Ive said this once but Im gonna be 18 next Saturday  IM SO EXCITED
