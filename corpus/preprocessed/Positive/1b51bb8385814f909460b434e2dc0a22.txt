
So when I was 14 and still discovering my sexuality
We went swimming at the pool I saw this girl there who was really really cute She was wearing a yellow coverup and seemed kind of nervous

After awhile I saw her take the coverup off She was wearing a blue bikini Yes I checked her out and I noticed that she had the cutest little stretch marks on her hips and legs

Honestly she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen stretch marks included

A message for her and every other person who has stretch marks or other things labelled as imperfections Whether you know it or not you and your body are beautiful and you might be driving someone like me crazy with nervousness because we think youre so awesome
