
So I just want to put something out thereyou do not need to be perfect to feel like you can have fun You do not need to be perfect to have a good time with your friends or try new things You dont need to be perfect before you start living your life

After this weekend Im just sick of it I really am Ive been dealing with this forever and I have so many of my girlfriends telling me I wish I could do that if I looked like her Id do that too I dont want to do that because everyone will think Im too fatuglyjiggly or whatever and we put ourselves into this place where only the deserving can do what makes them happy What would make US happy too Why

On Friday I jumped into my friends pool in my underwear in front of complete strangers and it was awesome I would never have done something like that a few years ago I thought that sort of fun was only for skinny or thick women not regular girls like me I would deny myself fun because thats not for people like me and thats so ridiculous My cellulite was out my butt was jiggly sure people were laughing but because it was FUNNY It was FUN and unexpected I HAD FUN Me with my Regular bodyhow dare I enjoy myself right pools and water and swimming and shortshorts and anything else are for everyone Everyone deserves to swim in the middle of a summer night and feel the water against their skin I do you do everyone

My friend told me she really wants to rock climb but is too shy that everyone will stair at her butt NO ONE cares And if they do Give them a show Shake that ass and climb that rock suck at it be great at it it doesnt matter Were human for gods sake Were not meant to be eye candy robots were here to enjoy this life Dont wait until youre perfect to live because most likely that day will never come I might not have a perfectly toned body but I have a brain full of memories with my friends who dont care what I look like Ill have stories to tell for the rest of my life about the fun Ive had when I just let go of these things that weigh us down and that tell us that we dont deserve to have fun

My biggest regret is knowing all of the memories i missed out on because of my insecurities I wont do it anymore
