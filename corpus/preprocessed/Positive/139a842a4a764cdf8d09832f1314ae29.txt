
So i just tried my bikini on from last year and you know friggin what I am going to wear it at the pool in 2 weeks and not give a monkeys Its a high waisted size 12 combo from topshop and im a uk size 10 so my boobs arent quite big enough for the bralette sigh and the pants are slightly baggy but i actually felt that i looked okay in the mirror I hardly ever feel like this so to see myself in anything less that jeans and a shirt and not think i look like an overflowed souffl is a pretty big achievement for me The past 2 weeks i have been adamant that i wont be wearing a bikini and just wear a tshirt or black swimming costume because i have flabby bits even though i could walk past in my high waister duo and some woman sitting on a sun lounger may think wow she looks great Sure my waist isnt very defined and gives my sides a slightly cushioned appearance but I am going to enjoy my holiday and the luxury of actually being able to afford one and I just want to relax without a care in the world The last time i wore this bikini was 18months ago when i weighed 19lbs heavier but ironically i feel even more conscious of my body now Oh the psychological pleasures of losing weight Anyways I cant wait to get to the pool now and soak up all that vitamin D goodness
