I thought I might write a post about tips on what might be useful for being with someone with body confidence issues It can be tough with the ups and downs with the good and bad days but if youre in a relationship with someone with body issues youre not alone Remember all these are personal experiences I have had and how I feel and what I would like to have in a relationship

Be patient listen
Sometimes it may get frustrating hearing them say time and time again I feel so ugly today or I look so fat It may sound like theyre fishing for compliments but in most cases theyre genuinely not They may just feel comfortable enough with you to be able to voice how they feel It may not be like that for everyone but I can assure you coming from my perspective if I mutter something along those lines its for me to hear or I would like comfort from my partner There will be days where all they can do is look in the mirror and cry Assuring them that they are beautiful in their own right that they have amazing qualities to be admired in themselves and that they are loved can do absolute wonders
Do not blame yourself
Again this comes with frustration of feeling helpless that nothing you can say can get through to them You are not doing anything wrong Sometimes its hard to hear compliments and believe them but the fact that youre putting in the time love care and effort to help make them feel better is incredible Encourage them to accept compliments because the sooner they can start accepting a kind word is a step closer to them believing it
Try and place yourself in their shoes
There may be an underlying reason why they feel this way about themselves That theyve been bullied before harassed judged and been made to feel this way If they have opened up to you about some situations that theyve been through for example severe bullying and name calling it may be helpful for you to place yourself in their shoes and think of how you would feel if it happened to you at that stage of your life It can give you a better understanding of why they feel the way that they do now
Do not compare them to other girlsboys youve dated
This ones happened to me before Its hard even for someone without body confidence issues to be compared to someone that their partner has been with before If you start comparing their situation to your current partner it can feel horrible I have a way of twisting things in my head picturing people and turning it against me Many others in my situation do the same too Its just a dark road I wouldnt go down especially if you care about them
No means no
Sex and opening yourself up is a completely terrifying thing If your partner is feeling particularly selfconscious and doesnt want to get intimate do not force them to This isnt just for people with body confidence issues this goes for anybody If someone is not comfortable in sharing their body with you in that moment do not guilt trip them or make them feel horrible It is sexual harassment For people who have body issues it doesnt mean that they feel like this all the time It may take a while for them to open up or they might be having a particularly selfconscious day Do not take it personally or try to make them feel bad about it  they may just feel uncomfortable in their own skin and not be able to share it with someone else at that time
Dont be dismissive of their feelings
You may see them as the most beautiful intelligent gorgeous human being in the world but unfortunately they dont feel that way all of the time Dont tell them to get over it or get aggressive and not take their feelings genuinely If people feel as if their feelings arent valid or arent important that could start them on a downward spiral or selfhatred
Dropping random compliments
Even saying something like that dress looks awesome on you or I like the way youve done your hair today can mean a world of difference Doesnt mean you have to be grovelling at their feet saying theyre the prince or princess but its nice to be appreciated Im sure youd like the same back
Ensure that you get treated well too
Its all well and good to give helpful hints on how to be in a relationship with someone with body confidence issues But remember that you are worth respect love care and attention too I think people can lose sight of these things when theyre with a partner that may need a bit more attention Have time for yourself and remember to keep open and honest
There you go Hopefully this is a little bit helpful Theres a lot of different aspects to low selfesteem so I wanted to discuss what would helpful for me If you have any ideas let me know and Ill add them on Thanks for reading
