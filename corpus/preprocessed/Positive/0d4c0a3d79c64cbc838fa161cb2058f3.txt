I believe that you make yourself feel insecure you make your flaws come out when you focus on them everyday
WAKE UP AND TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT YOURSELF 
bc life is wayyyyy too short for you to focus on your insecurities everyday
you have to make yourself believe that you are beautiful because if you dont love who you are every single day no one is going to recognize how beautiful you are
your beauty shines through how you perceive yourself
NO ONE IS GOING TO LOVE YOU UNTIL YOU FULLY LOVE YOURSELF
