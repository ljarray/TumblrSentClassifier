
Hi
Hello

So for those of you who dont know Im Tori  and to get to the point I have had issues with self esteem and self acceptance my entire life I started this blog as a fitblr because I hated my body and was dedicated to losing weight for a while

Then I slipped up and fell back into a hole of depression I tried to fill with food

That hasnt helped anything and Ive come to the realization that I cant like myself or my body only when Im skinny In order to be healthy in all aspects I have to love myself to want to be healthy

And since Im not healthy I need to start with love

So this is my new journey To find love and happiness with myself Yes I will exercise and be mindful of food because I need that to be physically healthy but I also am working on loving myself for who I am

I am worthy of loving myself

And just so you know you are too
