
Well I Never
Well I Never

I will never be skinny
I will never have big boobs
I will never be tall
I will never have a six pack
I will never be able to go out in a high wind and look sexily windblown

I will never give up on fitness
I will never take for granted the fact that I have healthy boobs small as they may be
I will never underestimate the power of platforms
I will never stop doing crunches and lower back exercises so that my core is strong
I will never forget that people would KILL for my curls

I will never understand
Why I can write this and know it and preach it and believe it
Yet only truly feel it on certain days in certain lights with certain caveats

But I will never stop trying
Until I feel it every single day of my life
