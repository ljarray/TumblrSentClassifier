
my health is so much more important than my body size and shape so I have figured out a diet plan that works well for me and my lifestyle and im really motivated and excited to go on this healthier living journey of course getting to fit in more cute clothes is going to be a plus as well but peoples opinions about my body is so unimportant to me I love who I am no matter what size and since I have closed a chapter of my life filled with self hate lack of self confidence depression and anxiety I am now going to start taking care of myself by giving my body the nutrition that it has been craving for the longest time
