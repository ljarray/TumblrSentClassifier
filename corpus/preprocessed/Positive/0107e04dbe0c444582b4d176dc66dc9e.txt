
I feel so different recently Last night I went to the gym for the first time in over a year and I didnt realise how much my body had changed since not going

After a year of horrible disordered thinking being 5ft9 and UK sizes 6810 and thinking I was obese crying all the time about how fat I was while going to the gym as much as possible I completely went the opposite way I started binge eating a lot it was basically a horrible experience and took me back to my childhood when I was overweight and would binge after school

While binging I started to feel less horrible about my body I gained a bit of weight but didnt mind as much as I would have whilst dietingexercising Ive definitely gained more than I would have liked but now Im just focusing on how I can change my body back to a healthy fit state My mindset changes as soon as I leave uni Im glad Im out of that toxic situation I was in for two years home is a much more healthy place to be

Im excited for what is to come and I cant wait for the progress pictures
