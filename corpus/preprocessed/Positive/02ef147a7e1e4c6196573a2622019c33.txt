
This is something Im gonna have a hard time putting into words so bear with me
Theres all this love going around tumblr about being body positive and loving what you look like no matter what and thats fantastic I also see a lot of posts building up girls with thick thighs and chubby arms and big bellies and large boobs and ive reblogged almost all of them and I think theyre great And i dont know if theres anyone else out there shaped like me because no matter where I look i cant find someone talking about girls in the middle with weirdly proportioned bodies Even posts highlighting the diversity of real women and not photoshopped modelstheres no one that looks like me So I want to make an appreciation post for girls or anyone really who feels like even with all the body positive posts and campaigns you STILL feel like you look different because youre in this weird middle ground between thickcurvyvoluminous and athletictoned or skinny 

Heres to the girls like me with wide hips and broad shoulders with thighs that arent really big but you still have to shop for jeans that fit your thighshipsbutt instead of your waist Heres to girls that store their fat solely in their tummies and in turn feel like they look pregnant all the time Heres to the girls who feel like only half their body is appreciated by Thick girls appreciation posts because they have big hips and thick thighs and soft bellies but they have small boobs and slim arms Heres to the girls with boobs that are two complete different cup sizes that you still worry about even though your doctor and everyone else says its normal because they are just SO different 

Heres to the girls who get called fat by some people and skinny by others and dont know what to think Heres to the girls that eat right and exercise every day and their bodies still hold onto fat like theres no tomorrow Heres to the girls who feel like their lower half takes up too much space in pictures 

Heres to the girls in the weird middle ground who may not even feel like they fit THIS post Heres to girls who feel like theyre only half appreciated or built up by a community that means well Heres to the girls who feel curvy on one day and stick thin the next 

This post is for the girls who cant find someone who feels the same way they do Because I do Even if you dont look like ME and you feel like no one else has the same body as you I know how you feel
