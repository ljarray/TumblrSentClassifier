
Anonymous SelfCare Submission
Self care to me means loving yourself being happy with yourself  simply being proud of how far you have come From where I started years ago I was unhappy  I hated my reflection in the mirror  the one thing I needed most was change I joined a gym two and a half years ago  finally began working for that change I wanted I set goals for myself worked towards them accomplished them and continue to set new goals to keep myself going Eating healthy is also half of the battle Do things in your life that will benefit you whenever you get the chance but stay kind to others around youIf you dont like something you can always change it Happy self care day
