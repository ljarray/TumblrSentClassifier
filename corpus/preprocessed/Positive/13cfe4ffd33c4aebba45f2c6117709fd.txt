
Being Comfortable As Me
Im still learning 
to be comfortable in my own skin
Its not easy 
but Im getting there 
A little less filter 
on my pictures 
A little less make up 
on my face 
A little bit more smile 
in public 
A little more confidence 
each day 
TBC

 smile body positive body image self love self esteem confidence
