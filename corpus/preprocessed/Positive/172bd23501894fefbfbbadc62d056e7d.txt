
My summer body is ready AF
So A few days ago I bought a bikini online and today it has arrived 
I should put as disclaimer that I havent worn a costume made someone see me with one or went to the beachpool in over 5 years now After the loss of my father I put on a shitloads of weight and I went from thin to extremely overweight 
I spent the past 2 years in London away from close minded people I worked very hard on myself my hidden big ego probably helped too and I can say that now I am very close to being confident in the body I am in even though I want to lose weight and become healthy again 

Two weeks ago I came back to Italy to see family and friends and my hardearned confidence threatened to leave me for comments such as if you put those shorts on while were together Im gonna be ashamed of being out with you or you are too fat and your hips are too big you cant wear that maxi skirt Needless to say I had several panic attacks and crying fits not because Im a baby who cant take negative comments but because I missed home and I didnt want to lose the confidence I gained in two years 
So Whats best to feel comfortable again in my own skin than to buy a bikini 
Today I put it on for the very first time and I gotta say it I didnt feel comfortable knowing that tomorrow tons of people are gonna see me half naked I dont look good in it and I know it my legs are big my hips are big my tummy is big But you know what Im so damn tired of not doing what I enjoy doing and Im tired of hiding again So eff if all 

Screw my fears screw body standards screw summer body Ive been waiting 5 years to go to the pool so MY SUMMER BODY IS MORE THAN READY Its literally no not literally screaming Ive done my waiting 12 years of it IN AZKABAN And its true my fears were like a prison Its safe to say my body is Sirius Black meaning Im freaking hot 
So yeah heres a pic of a happy me who achieved her goal and is ready to take on the next challenge 


Girls remember you are only who you let yourself think you are Think positive look in the mirror and smile because you are alive and beautiful and a freaking force of nature You got it all
