
The Perfect Girl
Everyone seems to want the perfect girl 

Beauty from head to toe

I do too 

I want beautiful hair

  Styled to accentuate her unique personality  

I want beautiful eyebrows  

  Showing honesty in every expression  

 I want beautiful eyes  

So when I look into them  

I see her compassionate soul  

 I want a beautiful nose  

To use to pick the freshest flowers  

 I want beautiful lips  

That say the kindest words  

To both loved ones and strangers  

 I want beautiful teeth  

That light up the room when smiling  

 I want a beautiful chest  

To rest my head on  

And hear her comforting heartbeat  

 I want a beautiful stomach  

To enjoy great meals with  

 I want beautiful arms  

To pick me up when Im down  

 I want beautiful legs  

Strong from several hard days work  

 And most importantly  

I want beautiful feet  

To walk alongside me  

Wherever I choose to go
