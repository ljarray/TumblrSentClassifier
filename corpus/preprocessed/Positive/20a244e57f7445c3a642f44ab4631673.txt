
its so strange to me that i have more confidence in my body now at a size 12 than i did 8 years ago when i was a size 6

im not saying im healthier at a 12 because im definitely not i really shouldnt be over an 8 or 10 but somehow im more okay with my stretchmarks and tummy rolls now its probably the fact that i have a lot more of them than i did when i was 15 and healthy but i was constantly covering up my stomach back then wed go to the beach and id wearing a bikini and look amazing but the moment we sat down on our towels i would wrap my arms around my stomach or find an excuse to throw my tank top back on so no one could see the normal rolls in my stomach when i slouched i carry the majority of my weight in my stomach i always have and i always will it kinda sucks to be honest

i dont know if its because im older and bodyimage is less of an issue for me or because ive followed so many blogs who are also bodypositive and and stuff its probably that tbh but im okay with my body sure it would be much better for me if i was at a lower weight and id be healthier and stuff but im okay at the weight im at i havent gained anymore weight and im actually slowly very slowly loosing it i actually enjoy looking at the stretchmarks on my thighs the ones on my hips are still thick and bruise colored but the ones on my thighs are thin and light and can only be seen if youre really looking for them they look like flashes of lighting sure there are more of them than id like but theyre there so what are you gonna do you might as well embrace em
