
exception of change
I love how it says body 
One thing I find hard to accept is the change of my body  other things I now dont find as hard to Ive been away two weeks and granted not a lot will have have changed that Ive noticed but its there At one stage in my life I would let it get to me and I would try to adjust but its not a change in me so why should I
Granted Ive put holiday weight ona problem that roots deep inside me which I find hard to grasp But THAT is a change for me which again I will not adjust to BUT CHANGE  for my self worth and happiness
Someone told me  do it for you and no one else 
I will

 body image change acceptance self worth happpiness
