
Obsession
I know its been a while but something prompted me to come back to this space of mine to talk about something thats been bothering me lately

Ive been obsessing over the way my body looks Ive been insecure and uncomfortable in my skin and down on myself etc etc etc for months I dont weigh myself dont even own a scale so its all based on how I feel how I look and how my clothes fit And Ive hated it all I think I finally turned a corner this week I think Im finally back to being pleased or mostly pleased with the way my body looks and feels 
All this to say  dont get down on yourself about the way you feel about your body Dont obsess but dont let people make you feel bad for being unhappy either Take in all those feelings and put in a few weeks of hard work and exercise and healthy whole foods and watch how amazing you are and how incredible your body is and how it responds to those changes 
All this to say  it takes some work to be happy in your own skin And thats ok because its worth it
 body issues body image health is relative love your body love yourself
