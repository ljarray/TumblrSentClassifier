
I keep seeing that one account linking a curvy vs fat article to a bunch of posts and Yikes its horrible and just plain rude and I wanna say something but Im a big baby 

 yikes tho I hate that its so mean like just let people be confident and happy with who they are stop trying to label and pinpoint and call out a body type layna posts negative body image
