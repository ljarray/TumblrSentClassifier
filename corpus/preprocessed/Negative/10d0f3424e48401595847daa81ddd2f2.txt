
I just saw someone say thats what a womens body should look like imo under a girls picture like

first off no one gives a fuck what you think a woman should look like and second its so fucked up that youd even say that because there are a lot of women who dont have her body shape and are still beautiful

I really hate men that think theyre opinions are worthy of the world when it does nothing but exclude so many other people
