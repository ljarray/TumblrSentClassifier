
So I wrote a poem and thought it was alright
18
I leave this earth with the body weight of 36kg 
My heart ticks out under the cover of my grossly protruding ribcage
Hollowed cheeks and shadowed eyes turn cold
And my soul breathes a sigh of relief as it escapes its prison of bones

175
They call this place a safe haven Its not
Dead eyes stare vacantly at me
And I wonder if mine mirror theirs
My limbs are strapped down like you would a rabbid animal
And Im forced to watch them pump poison into my veins
They tell me to eat Eat Eat
But I havent reached 40 yet 
Then I will stop 
Then I will be beautiful

17
I stand naked in front of the mirror
My hips jutting out from my pasty skin
I can count each of my ribs easily now
But its not enough
Not enough
Not enough
I pile my clothes on in layers
Stuffing areas to give the illusion of curves
Only to keep my parents intrusions at bay
As I walk downstairs a wave of dizziness sweeps over me
My chest tightens and I feel strangley disconnected
I collapse

165
Hunger is aliving feral thing that lives in the pit of my stomach
It wriggles its way into my lungs
Making me breathless after the smallest of movements
It chews away at my brain
Consuming my every thought
But I am stonger

16
I drink 3 litres of water in the bathroom before stepping on the scales
Theres a mummer of approval from my parents
I fight the rising panic as I see a kilo increase from last time
Reining it in I beam a smile at the doctor
She eyes me with a mixture of suspision and pity
All boxes are ticked and Ive escaped admission
This time

155
My index finger has become my best friend
One jab from her and I can expell my mistake
Acid burns my troat
My stomach roars in protest
Hands tremble on the sides of the toilet bowl
Its like it never happened
So why do I feel so guilty


15
I meet a girl who paints her face to hide whats beneath
Death white skin Hollowed cheeks
I can see her bones protruding from her shirt
Shoulder blades like broken wings
Hip bones and ribs ready to break skin 
She is beautiful

14
Boys notice me at school now
I am the same size as the other girls
But I want to be better
I skip breakfast and only drink water during the day
Ill stop when I reach 50

13
I want to be like the girls in the magazines
Long legs and tiny waists
I run everyday now
I eat only organic foods
People say I look great
I feel great

12
I dread the long summer days
It means our class is due for swimming
On the days I cant feign sick I cower in the corners
Hidding beneath my towel while the other girls parade
Their delicate figures enhanced by tight togs
I wear a Tshirt to cover my bulky arms and bloated belly
If they are mermaids then I am a seal
Once a group of boys pushed me into the pool
My splash soaked their entire group
The Tshirt clung to my lumps like a becon of shame
The classes laughter still rings in my ears

11
I addition for the school play
I wanted to be Cinderlla
But was casted as the fairy godmother
I overhear a girl say I shouldve been the pumkin carriage

10
I saved all my pocket money for a dress
Soft as silk and glittering blue like stars
I grab the largest size to try on
I tug and squeeze and pull
The shop lady has to come and help me
But it rips
When Im finally out she offers me it for free
Her kind eyes full of pity
I leave it and run

9
My friends and I have piggy back races
Im always the carrier
Or is it called the piggy
But I dont mind
I like being the strongest

A thin lady stares at me with disgust
My shirt and mouth sticky with ice cream
She stares me up and down with a frown
I poke my tongue at her

6

5
I want to be a ballarina when I grow up
Mummy says I can be anything I want
I leap around and pretend Im a dancer
Imagining that I am flying through the air
I am light I am free

4

2
Im always picked up for hugs and cuddles
Showered with kisses
Strangers stop Mummy in the street
To coo and smile at me in my pram
Everbody thinks Im beautiful

1

I enter this earth with the body weight of 36kg 
My heart ticks on under the cover of my tiny ribcage
As a premature I am lucky to be alive
Rosy cheeks and bright blue eyes turn warm
And my soul breathes a sigh of relief as it settles into its new home
