
Its very hard to be a mixed kid in a predominately white area but its even harder when youre not conventionally attractive I have literally heard someone say She must get that from her fathers side as if my fathers blackness is the reason behind my weight and stature and not my upbringing and general laziness 

So heres to all my fellow multiracial kids who have a hard enough time fitting into one society based on their race and have to add to the struggle because of their bodies Its not fair but I love you
