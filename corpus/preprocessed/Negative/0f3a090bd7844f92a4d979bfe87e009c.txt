
Eating Disorder
Freshman year of high school I formed an eating disorder causing me to lose weight at an unhealthy rate I ate only one meal a day and maybe a snack or two I went from 118 to under 100 in less than a month I did this for a long time

My parents never said anything about me losing weight even though they noticed Their lack of care still bothers me

I gained my weight back by myself after having a life realization moment I even gained more than when I started

Now I am having trouble with my confidence again I cant look in the mirror without cringing at the fat on my body People tell me I am skinny and get rude with me when I try to explain why I dont like my weight

This is who I am I am someone who has thought they were fat almost half of their life It is hard to change the opinion of myself I have always lacked confidence in my body You cant just gain confidence in a day
