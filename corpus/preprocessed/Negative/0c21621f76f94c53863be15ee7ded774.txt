
I just have one small issue with this positive body image movement Im all for people feeling good about themselves not judging based on looks and feeling beautiful without having a models figure That being said I feel one thing should be said  encouraging obesity is not okay That is a HEALTH RISK That doesnt mean you have to tell these people that they are ugly it means you have to encourage them to be healthy Moreover I have an issue with everyone beautifying smoking Maybe its just me but I feel that that too is wrong You are encouraging people to smoke and to harm their bodies  again this is another health issue I have no issue with anyone smoking if thats what you want to do then do it but do not encourage others to do so as well We are encouraging unhealthy habits by masking it as being against judgement Im all for this no judgement but I draw a line at encouraging unhealthy habits
