
MASSIVE RANT

i just dont even know where to start talking about whats wrong with these articles who fuckin cares if they have cellulite its natural its ok for it to happen how does the media want us to feel about ourselves if they portray women this way

they just play the hypocrite and launch these love your body campaigns while on the other side theyre gnawing at famous women whom are easier to attack for their excessive mediatic and public exposure for a little roll on their bellies or some cellulite on their bum

and worst part people contribute to the hipocrisy some people open these articles and gasp oh my god look at her ass looks like a bag of ice thats gross at least try to cover it up fun part is they are probably 30kg heavier than these modelsactresses and what if they are we are all worthy and deserve respect oh THERE the media is quick to defend body image arent they same shit different toilet

oh but I am a real woman they are actresses i am allowed to look this way no fuck you theyre real women too with real feelings thoughts desires and wishes and youre just critizicing the things they PROBABLY cant control although they do something to try and control it they probably work out every day and have a strict diet just for the media and themselves too

BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THE VENOMOUS MEDIA JUST CANT LEAVE THEIR SEATS STARING AT THEIR PICTURES WAITING FOR A LOVEHANDLE TO SHOW A NIPPLE TO SLIP A SKIRT TO GO A BIT ABOVE APPROPRIATE LENGTH OR CELLULITE TO SHOW

they need to protect themselves from peoples poisonous comments and stares so would you wouldnt you they still feel they gain fat yes they probably have paid personal trainers and a personal diet chef and whatnot but its their job for their body is their image their portfolio sadly and they just need to be in mint condition they try to avoid bad comments

but there will always be a magazine waiting for a picture they can outline in bold colors and highlight a tiny little hole in their BEAUTIFUL legs only to claim that theyve lost control of their lives and are headed towards a downward spiral of fat 

i know most of you people are bodylovers spreading bodylove all over the world thank you for that we appreciate it im in no way trying to offend you but if the shoe fits

 rant probably useless body image body positive excuse my english i aint a native english speaker
