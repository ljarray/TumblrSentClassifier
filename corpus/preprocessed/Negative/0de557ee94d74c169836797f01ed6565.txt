
okay rant time as a fat person i really think its wrong to tell skinny people not to cosplay fat characters when i was a child i was severely underweight and constantly picked on by kids for it but thats whatever thats my personal experience and i know its usually a lot different but the point is i hated my body and when i think back to that i wish i had found cosplay then because maybe i would have been ok with myself more

I dont feel like anythings being stolen i feel like its sharing when a skinny person dresses up as a fat character because ive been on both sides and i know the feeling behind both of them

not to mention people keep forgetting about people who are kin or people who are autistic and latch onto characters like sometimes its not just i want to cosplay this character itll look cool haha its more like i love them so much i feel connected with them they make me feel empowered and good and i desperately need to connect myself with them in any way i can

like most people i know do that most people who are skinny who would want to cosplay this character would be doing that the same way a fat person would want to cosplay a skinny character its obviously not for looks its because they like the character so imo stop leaving out mental illnessdisability and kin stuff when you talk about this issue bc a lot of times they go hand in hand

people think cosplay is solely for looks because hey its a costume duh but its become so much more than that for people its not about how the character looks for me i relate to their experiences or personality what they deal with their flaws and struggle and success when im wearing a costume for my favorite character whether at home or at a convention i feel more confident and alive and verbal than i ever am for an autistic teen riddled with anxiety thats a lot for me yknow being able to come out of my shell for a bit

i obviously cant speak for the entire fat community or for the autistic community but please listen to me when i say this cosplay has changed my life and many others lives and i want it to continue changing peoples lives i dont want people to hate themselves like i did no matter what size they are and no matter their disabilities

 cannt wait to get anon hate for this mm rant body image cosplay long post original
