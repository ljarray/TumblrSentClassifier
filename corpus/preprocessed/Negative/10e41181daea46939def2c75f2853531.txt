
Im craving sugar so much the past few days which leads to overeating and its annoying me because like I feel so fat Like Im physically not putting any weight or fat on but mentally I feel huge and idk it doesnt feel good and I hope it goes away because I feel so gross because I was making so much progress with the exercise and now I feel like Im throwing all of that away idk

 body image food ignore me
