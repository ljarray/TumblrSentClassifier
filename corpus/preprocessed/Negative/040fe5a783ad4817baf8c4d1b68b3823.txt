
Ive started to diet like Ive cut out soda sweets and Im thinking of doing a semi vegan thing to see how well I do and who knows after that but

I dont know at what age I started thinking that no one will love me if I dont lose weight but it certainly hasnt faded over the years 

I need to love myself more
