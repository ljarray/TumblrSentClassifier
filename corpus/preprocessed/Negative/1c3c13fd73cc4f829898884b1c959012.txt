
So I officially backed out of going to a beach event because of my body And it is so crazy complicated I like my body most days Its strong and I am in love with my legs Im a little more than ten pounds over the weight is like to be  but Im not even sure that thats the problem I would have been one of if not the most physically fit girl there And I know this sounds stupid but Ive been shunned by bigger girls before Because Im too skinny to be plus sized or curvy  and I do t know maybe its a defence mechanism thing But it sucks because I feel like I get shunned by both groups Im to slender to be  cute and curvy but Im too big to be classically skinny My body type makes classically skinny impossible And almost every time I look in the mirror I think that Im not doing enough That I should be doing more I dont want to fall into that hole again but damn it nine times outta ten I feel like Im just looking down over the ledge
