
Hi Ive had a shit day I just had to help my mum put my nan in a nursing home I had to chase my demented nan down the driveway and have her try to hit me My mum was in tears
And I come home to bullying on my body image shirts Guys there are styles that go up to 5XL You just have to click reserve now then you can select the size and quantity 
Seriously Im trying to do something helpful for the body image movement Im trying to help people And I get told to fuck off 
Please if youre worried about the sizes click reserve now then select your desired design and size Im doing what I can with what is provided Teespring offer better sizes than a lot of crowd funding shirt sites

Please stop being nasty to me Im only trying to help
