
Fall Then Get Back Up
There are days when we stumble and then days when we completely fall flat on our faces Some stay down and some get up and keep going Ill admit when it came to weight loss I would always do the first Fall and give up I would have the mindset that when I fell there was no way to get up again Depressing right It was Ive changed though

Last night I gave myself a wake up call I needed to I had to remind myself I was doing something that was working but I had to be more disciplined than I was Being more disciplined didnt mean starting over like I always thought it did It just meant learning and then improving

Being on a weight loss journey is always going to be difficult No matter what the parameters are You can be as disciplined and as determined as you want but there will be times where you stumble or fall It took years for me to realize that falling was just a part of the journey Nothing more

If theres anyone reading this and is on the same journey as I am message me Well talk Whatever you feel you need to speak about just message me Take care  never give up
