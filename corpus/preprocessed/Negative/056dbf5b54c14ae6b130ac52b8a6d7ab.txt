
The culture that is developing in this society is fucking stupid Were creating a culture that is meant to make everyone feel good and have no ones feelings hurt Were coddling the weak and punishing the strong for not coddling them as well You dont deserve to have your feelings taken care of because thats your own fucking job You take care of yourself You are your own responsibility and its no one elses job especially not societys to make you feel good or better about yourself You have low self esteem Why is that anyone elses job to fix that You should find confidence on your own No one can give it to you Youve been made fun of your whole life That sucks But thats still no one elses problem Its called survival and the world is a shitty place Its never going to be this magical utopia that all these tumblr activists and army of we had a hard life because society hates us want it to be If you have emotional problems then you need to learn to fix them How do you expect to be stronger if you dont push through the shit that hurt you Cowering away in the corner yelling we feel bad wont change shit Change yourself Love yourself You cant force anyone to like you or love you This whole acceptance movement is great but its turning into this thing that everyone is overly offended because they arent included or theyre too excluded or too different or too the same or too whatever NO ONE GIVES A SHIT Give a shit about yourself and the people you love and who love you too and thats all you fucking need This whole thing about changing societys perspective is to make weak people who cant accept themselves feel better Thats their own goddamn fault  If you cant love yourself because society said youre ugly or stupid or fat then youre weak Fuck society Fuck what anyone says about you Why the fuck does that matter to you Do something about it if it makes you feel bad Make the change in your own goddamn life and work hard for what will make you feel good

This culture is making people lazy People want to be spoon fed everything They dont want to work for things If something makes them feel bad they want to cry until they get what they want Thats essentially what the entire generation is turning out to be  cry babies Fucking grow up and work for something like your self image your intelligence your confidence This whole war to make people feel better about selves is a waste of time and gives people the idea they are entitled to feel good without working for it Society shouldnt have  to make them feel good they should learn to make themselves feel good and earn it Thats when people will gain some fucking responsibility for themselves
