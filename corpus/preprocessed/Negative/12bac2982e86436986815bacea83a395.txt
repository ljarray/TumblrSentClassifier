
Today I cried so much because of my height and my weight and my chubby and my freckles and big teeth and dark curly thick hair and my face hair and now I feel angry at myself for it and Im really embarrassed that I let anyone look through me on Saturday or that Id even dare think Im a worse person because Im big and clumsy
Thin pale people arent intrinsically better people they arent more delicate or more vulnerable
Being messy and chubby and frizzy haired doesnt make you worse even though thats what the caricature ugly idiot looks like lol I really really hate this stuff I really hate it I hate that Ive hated my appearance since I was 3 and I hate that I used to make my mother cry before I could even remember just because I hated my hair and my face I hate it I hate it so much and I hate this revolting website for glorifying the beauty industry and I hate everything

 body image I guess
