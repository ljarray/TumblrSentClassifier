
my grandmother and sister were talking about how my cousin uses photoshop to edit her pictures and they both huffed and puffed and said they pittied her and how sad it must be to have to change how you look to feel better about yourself gosh like thats like lying to the world about who you really are whats wrong with her it makes me angry because it was my cousins decision to do that and she has the right to contour her face if it makes her feel better to apply lipstick and eyeshadow and even to edit pictures if it makes her feel better about her appereance its disscusting that people think they can just judge people like that and pity people that are just trying to feel happy about their body

 ew why are people so stupid and mean UHG family of idiots and then they tell me i overeact theyre just spreading negative thoughts sigh i wish people were nicer to each other body image youre beautiful ok
