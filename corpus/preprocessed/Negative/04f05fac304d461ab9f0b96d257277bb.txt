
Fear of the Light
I first saw you in the dark of night 
With fingers that traced curves without judgement
With lips that tasted stretch marks and scars without disgust
Blushes did not blemish but only warmed your skin
You let inhibition go and cast off insecurities to pool next to your clothes
You revealed yourself to me in tremors and gasps
Gave yourself to me without regret
But in the morning it was different
I kissed you and you shied away
Hid beneath the satin sheets
You turned your back to don your clothes
And would not look me in the eye
You trusted the dark more than me to find you beautiful
And I began to wonder who had hurt you so
That the only mirror in your possession was only big enough to show your face
And that all your clothes had the tags ripped out
You kept the lighting low and the curtains long
Hiding from a world you feared would judge
If only you could step in my shoes and see through my eyes
Youd know the only one judging you
Is you
