
Im boycotting my mirror 
After yesterday Im breaking up with my mirror for a week Analyzing my body for little changes everyday isnt healthy Ive become addicted to it Im thinking about it right now

I just need to stop worrying about this goal weight bullshit and relax Although I did want to meet my GW for my 21st birthday and I hate the thought of disappointing myself I need to make sure I stay mentally healthy
