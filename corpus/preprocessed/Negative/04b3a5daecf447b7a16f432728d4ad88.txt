
I feel like shit about myself
I have the ugliest body ever My shoulders are much wider than my hips my ass is small and droopy my boobs are small but look like cow udders I have trichotillomania which makes me rip my own hair out I have a double chin and Im only 16 my cellulite is out of control i have more stretch marks than any of my friends or family I only look pretty with makeup on and my stomach looks like I eat a whole ham by myself every night I work out 5 times a week and look worse now than I ever did before and I cant just stop because Im healthier than ever I lost 9 pounds but look like I gained 9 pounds but just in my stomach area I used to be curvy and had a huge ass and huge boobs and was proportionate and good looking and felt good about myself but now my body is an ugly mess and I hate it I want to change every part about it but I cant and it pisses me off so much I think im so ugly and every time someone tries to say Im not I dont believe them and it makes me feel even worse I feel like shit and my body looks awful and I hate it so much I try so hard to be positive about it but I cant anymore because Im surrounded by people with amazing bodies and I look like absolute shit
