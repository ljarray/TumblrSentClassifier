
Ramblings
So I was definitely overweight before I hit puberty and it was frustrating because Id get made fun of all the time I just hated myself so much back then but when puberty hit I started to lose a great deal of weight cuz I was working out and my metabolism went through the roof For the first time people were saying I was good looking and it made me feel fantastic and confident and proud of my body and who I was

As many of you know I had to take a good deal of steroids this year as part of my cancer treatment Also I had to be way less active than my body was used to so my body has been gaining weight way more rapidly than Id like and its really fucking with my head Im not fat by any means but I just feel so gross right now

I got so used to myself being skinny and fit that when I started to gain weight as rapidly as I have its been a huge shock for me

I guess what Im saying is I really need some encouragement to keep up my body positivity What have you guys done to help you out with your self image Or even just what are some ways I can lose weight but keep it safe and sane
