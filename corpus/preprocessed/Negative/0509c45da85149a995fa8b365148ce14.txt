Heyguys 3 
So I decided to make this post for newbies out there who want to start working out and lose some extra poundsFirstly I wanna say I wasnt skinny child like ever my diet was very unhealthy when i was around 10 yearsI would eat out of boredomwhen someone else was eating and basicallyno one cared bc i was just a kid plusalmost everyone in my family is plus sized so it was normalIn middle school i was constantly surrounded with skinny girls and skinny people and i became very lonely at the age of 14 i was considered that fat friend at least i started to see myself that wayI told myself that the only way i would be happyhave loyal friendsboyfriend etc is if i lose weightI started to google the best ways to achive my goal and became slightly obssesive with that matterNo one new what was going through my headi started to count calories and what i eatThen i saw scale slightly lowering and i was even more motivated and stopped eating sweets drinking sodabread and ate only so little that would satisfy my daily needsEverything that i would randomly read online on losing weight i would try out also i started to work out on a daily basisi did push upsto about 200 a day sometimes even more and jogg My muscles used to hurt so badbut i didnt carePeople i thought were my best friends started to turn against me and would tell me that im sick and i lost so much weight And i was sad once againLosing weight didnt help at all i hated going to school and felt judged all the time I started to eat healthy and continued working out but not that extremelyand felt good about itbut people became even more cruelI cried constantly and shoved my head into the  pillow and asked myself why am i even doing that i couldve stayed fat at least than i wasnt bullied by my so called friendsI will never forget my best friend telling me I was born skinny there is nothing i can do about itWhat you are doing is sick That stroke me like a bullet through my cheast so what if i was born fat i should just stay like thatThats bunch of bullcrap everyone is allowed to do whatever they feel is good for them if you want to cut you hair CUT ITif you want to dye your hairDO ITsociety constantly pushes new trends on us and portraits perfect bodies that are impossible to achive bc they are so fake and photoshopedYesterday curves where in today hip bones and tomorrow something else people are not objects we cant live up to does standards no one canPlastic surgeries are becomeing so common that people especially girls would rather starve themselves than accept who they are and celebrate their individualityEvery new generation is shoved with does standards thanks to internet and modern technologyI wish that in my lifetime i would be able to see that it doesnt matter how much money someone makesor what kind of clothes they wear but simply to be able to judge the person by their personality and inner beautyMy idea is be the best version of yourselfdont compare your body or abilities to no one you are uniquespecial and there is no one like youI know that if you are in school all of these is beyond the graspbut there is only one person that you need to make happy and that is youWhyWell people will come and go but you can always count on yourself and if you do everything in your life just to satify others you are setting yourself for one misserable life filled with anger and bitterness
