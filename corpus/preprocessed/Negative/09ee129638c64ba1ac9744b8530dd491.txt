
The fact that Serena Williams who is the best at what shes doing and shes proving it whenever she plays is being judged and criticized for something so irrelevant in her career cause i mean shes a tennis player right And she fucking plays her best What does that have to do with looking good She aint no supermodel She aint competing no beauty pageant She does not have to look a certain way Since when does tennis require players to look like a Victorias Secret angel She puts herself out there as a sports player and we all see that shes a winner And despite of that she still gets so much hate So i wonder if her as a top player is still facing this bullshit why will i get offended when somebody says something denigrating about me People are just nasty with whoever you are you cant just stop them
