Although postive efforts are being made to improve the racial diversity of fashion advertisements I cant help but notice that a vast majority of minority models have Caucasian feautures Although it is nice to see someone with golden brown or espresso skin in an advert I still feel as though the inherent beauty of diverse cultural heritages is being ignored As an Asian male I literally cannot think of a figure in pop culture that represents my demographic I have seen numerous videos and articles explaining why Asian males are viewed as unadatable or the least attractive combination of gender and ethnicity I saw an excercise video by a buff Asian male explaining how the only way women or men will want to date you is if you have big muscles According to this same video that has millons of views and millions of channel subscribers 93 of women find Asian men undatable so I should watch the video so I dont die alone Asian men are viewed negatively while Asian women are wrongfully appropriated hypersexualized and set as a standard of beauty as they have been for centuries It wasnt until very recently that I actually felt somewhat positively about my body image and appearance as an Asian male The fact that I was conditioned by media culture to arrive at negative conclusions about my appearance due to my race is deeply concerning

The lack of role models public figures and positive body image associated with my demographic is troubling and leaves many Asian men including myself feeling disenfranchised and rejected This goes for many other demographics as well but I can only speak on how it impacts my life We need to embrace cultural heritage and realize that beauty comes in all shapes sizes colors ages and nationalities
