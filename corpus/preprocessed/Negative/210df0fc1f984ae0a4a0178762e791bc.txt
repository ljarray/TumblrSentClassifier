
never getting positive attention from guys if someone was being friendly it was a joke  flirt with the ugly girl itll be funny means that I rly dont trust when guys give me positive attention now

honestly a lot of the time its probably still pity or a joke no one actually finds me attractive but even if it was genuine I wouldnt believe it Im still the ugly girl

 personal post negativity  body image Im not a girl but for simplicitys sake whatever Im very bitter and its 95 degrees out I cant be bothered
