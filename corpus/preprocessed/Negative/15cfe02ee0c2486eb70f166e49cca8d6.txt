
Is it just me or does any one else hate it when people call models not real women Like every model is just as much of a woman as anybody else Maybe they arent portrayed that way in media or their body type makes girls insecure or makes girls feel unrealistically about themselves but they are still WOMEN Dont diminish women because society places them on a high pedestal Love all women not just women feeling disadvantaged Models are women too

 this really gets on my nerves really dont do this model models rant women real women real woman woman feminism feminist equal women insecure body image body positivity body positive all women are beautiful
