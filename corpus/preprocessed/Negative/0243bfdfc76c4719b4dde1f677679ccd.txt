
C Living with hyperpigmentation has rendered my selfesteem basically nonexistent I havent worn a bathing suit in almost 15 years a tank top in 17 years I hate summertime the most My friends all want to go swimming or to the beach and I cant go I am constantly wearing longsleeves and hoodies I avoid lowcut shirts and shortshorts I dont feel at all attractive and will even keep a shirt on during sex I took it off once and although I was wellreceived I felt disgusting and still regret it I think about that one time I was entirely naked in front of this person and it makes me want to throw up I make me want to throw up

I find myself even in public staring at people who are able to show skin and it makes me anxious jealous It makes me question whether or not I will have any value to anyone if I cant look like that Why would someone choose me when they can choose someone they can actually stand to look at

I havent told anyone about it Some of my friends know I have hyperpigmentation but no one knows that it actually bothers me or that it makes me question myself constantly I hate it so much People dont mean to be hurtful but when they mistake my spots for track marks or ask what happened to you It kills me Nothing happened to me I was born this way I dont do drugs I never have

Sad part is I am a psychology student lol I know this level of selfesteem is not normal and I know my beliefs about myself are dangerously similar to body dysmorphic disorder but I cant stop Whenever I look in the mirror or think about myself I want to cry andor vomit Even writing this now I want to cry I want to be considered pretty so bad but any compliment I get I disregard My beliefs and behaviors although founded are not logical And yet I cant stop I guess a lifetime of sneers and probing questions really wears on you
