
Whenever people say that skinny people cant cosplay rose quartz it really bothers me like Im on the heavier side and I can see how itd be comforting to cosplay someone of the same body type but saying that is like saying that people who are heavier cant cosplay skinnier characters Honestly its like saying that I cant cosplay Pearl just because Im fat Every body type is beautiful Cosplay is about expressing yourself If someone is thinner and they want to cosplay someone of a different body type let them  whatever makes you happy
