
I felt disgusting today To the point that I wore a big shirt to the beach that covered everything from my thighs to neck In the water and everything I have no idea what I am going to do if I feel like this after swim season starts

I just Im so afraid I feel horrible about myself I look in the mirror and I dont even recognize myself
