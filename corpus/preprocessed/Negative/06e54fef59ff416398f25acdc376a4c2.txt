
I fucking hate the county fair I fit on one of the rides but they made me get off anyway for some stupid fucking reason and the rest of the skinny good looking people on the ride were staring at me and I know it shouldnt bother me but it really made me feel like shit I know the logical answer to this problem is lose weight but I was just beginning to become comfortable with my body and this kind of set me back like five steps I know it seems like an overreaction but I feel like crying
