
Im pretty hurt at the minute by the anti thigh gap shit going around Like seriously That isnt a choice for many people  some people genuinely cant not have thigh gaps and youre making them feel like shit when youre promoting body positivity Its the same double standards that you see in homophobia oh I love all gays except bisexuals etc and other discrimination

Its Not Fair We didnt choose this so dont blame us Many of us arent starving ourselves  we are a healthy weight People are basing the thigh gap on models  I have a thigh gap but Im no way close to anorexic Im just thin and Im fine with that Im not fine with people calling me a twig or skinny bitch and saying that I should eat more Its like telling someone overweight to eat less how is that supposed to help

This antithigh gap and antithin campaign needs to stop as well as the real women have curves one Grow up guys We come in different shapes and sizes  that is a real woman not one that is either a model or one that is curvy Promoting body image isnt shaming the other type because that isnt promoting body positvity its hiding your envy through hatred  and with hate comes discrimination and a bunch all else

Leave us thin people alone We have done nothing to you so dont you tell us were unnatural or not real women just because we have thigh gaps Focus on how confident you feel with your body instead of shaming others for theirs

 anti thigh gap thin discrimination body positivity overweight skinny thigh gap rant human rights women are women you dont need curves
