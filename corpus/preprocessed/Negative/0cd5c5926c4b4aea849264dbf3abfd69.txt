If someone is wearing makeup in the pool dont deliberately splash them
If someone has done their hair nicely dont mess it up
If someone in a tshirt has scars on their arms dont ask them about it
If someone doesnt want to get in the water dont push them
If someone still wants to wear jeans dont laugh at them for it
If someone has sweat patches dont point them out
If someones chest is obviously prominent dont stare
If you can see someones underwear binder dont comment on it 
If someone is blatantly covering something up dont try to reveal it

Not everyone can feel totally comfortable with the fact its Summer dont make them feel worse
