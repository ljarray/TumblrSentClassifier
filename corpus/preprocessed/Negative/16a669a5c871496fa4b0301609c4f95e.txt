
So I think I want to cut my hair off again 
I did it in early 2014 and I loved it And then my BPD began disabling and it caused me to have a weird identity crisis and hate myself deeply for no real reason for such a long time Ive spent so much time growing it out its down to my shoulders now But I dont like it It bothers me and I dont even do anything with it When I look into the future the person I want to be always has short hair But my mom and everyone else wants it to be long still and like What if it makes me have another weird identify crisis It was a large part of 2014 Hell Summer I blame it 100 on BPD but like I dont want to go through You cant be xyz because your hair is short and youre ugly I want short hair but Im scared of it backfiring on me
