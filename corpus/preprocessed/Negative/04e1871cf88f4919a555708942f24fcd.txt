
What I dont understand and what I do not like about this generation is you if love yourself youre considered selfish conceded but if you hate yourself youre considered an attention seeker or asking for attention I dont care what you call me but I hate myself Im too fat not pretty enough not good enough not smart enough Im just not enough I can name so many bad things about myself before you can name one you like Thats what I hate about how judgemental and cruel this generation has become Someone told me that no ones gonna love you until you learn to love yourself and thats the shittiest piece of advice Ive ever got I found someone who loves my body my laugh my smile my stupid comments That person loves me for me and I couldnt thank them enough for being by my side
