
Hypocrites
My fitness tumblr Under a separate account was deleted for fat shaming because I criticized the use of  fatspo as encouraging obesity which is just as unhealthy as people starving themselves to be thin 

I might have gotten a little abrasive in my discussion but that happens all the time I never singled anybody out or bullied anyone I never told anybody that they were ugly or bad or less than for their weight  I simply tried to ask why its OK to encourage obesity which has tons of scientific evidence to be unhealthy yet openly shame thin or fit people or those who prefer thin or fit bodies 

So I got mass reported and banned

Im sure I could contest it with staff but I have no desire to

I really hate Tumblr culture sometimes How is this OK

Ugh
