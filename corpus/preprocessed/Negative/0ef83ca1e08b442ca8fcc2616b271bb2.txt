
Corporate pigs
Youre to fat
Youre to thin
In this age will we ever win
Stick like idols
Corporate ghosts
The fake imagery that we follow the most 
Look what youve done
Look what you made
A generation that is way too afraid
Were sick and were starving
We eat and were sick
Because of the assholes that all act like pricks
Because Of the models
The standards we have
I am sick of your comments
Im sick of your view
Just look at yourselves
With shame as I do

For all those who wish to be a size 8
Your wonderful humans and I bet you look great
The business the money their all greedy pigs
For those who try and make us 
sick little sticks
