
Obsession
I know it?s been a while but something prompted me to come back to this space of mine to talk about something that?s been bothering me lately?

I?ve been obsessing over the way my body looks. I?ve been insecure and uncomfortable in my skin and down on myself etc etc etc for months. I don?t weigh myself, don?t even own a scale, so it?s all based on how I feel, how I look, and how my clothes fit. And I?ve hated it all. I think I finally turned a corner this week. I think I?m finally back to being pleased (or mostly pleased) with the way my body looks and feels. 
All this to say - don?t get down on yourself about the way you feel about your body. Don?t obsess, but don?t let people make you feel bad for being unhappy, either. Take in all those feelings and put in a few weeks of hard work and exercise and healthy, whole foods and watch how amazing you are and how incredible your body is and how it responds to those changes. 
All this to say - it takes some work to be happy in your own skin. And that?s ok, because it?s worth it.
