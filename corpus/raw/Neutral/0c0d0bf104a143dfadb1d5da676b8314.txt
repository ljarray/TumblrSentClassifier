
Okay guys, help me out here!
So I�m trying to lose some weight. I don�t feel that great about my body image overall, and I�ve been modeling as a side thing for about a year and a half now, but I�m starting to get more into it. I�m planning on getting back into eating less because this weekend I really ate too much and gained two pounds (that fast). So I would be really appreciative of you guys if you would bear with me when I make posts about this, and encouragement is really helpful!!! Love you guys~~
