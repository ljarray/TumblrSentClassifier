
I�m pretty hurt at the minute by the �anti thigh gap� shit going around. Like, seriously? That isn�t a choice for many people - some people genuinely can�t not have thigh gaps, and you�re making them feel like shit when you�re �promoting body positivity.� It�s the same double standards that you see in homophobia (oh, I love all gays except bisexuals, etc) and other discrimination.

It�s. Not. Fair. We didn�t choose this, so don�t blame us. Many of us aren�t starving ourselves - we are a healthy weight. People are basing the thigh gap on models - I have a thigh gap, but I�m no way close to anorexic. I�m just thin, and I�m fine with that. I�m not fine with people calling me a twig or skinny bitch and saying that I should eat more. It�s like telling someone overweight to eat less; how is that supposed to help?

This �anti-thigh gap� and �anti-thin� campaign needs to stop, as well as the �real women have curves� one. Grow up, guys. We come in different shapes and sizes - that is a real woman, not one that is either a model or one that is curvy. Promoting body image isn�t shaming the other type, because that isn�t promoting body positvity, it�s hiding your envy through hatred - and with hate comes discrimination and a bunch all else.

Leave us thin people alone. We have done nothing to you, so don�t you tell us we�re unnatural or not real women just because we have thigh gaps. Focus on how confident you feel with your body instead of shaming others for theirs.
