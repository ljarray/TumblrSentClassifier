
I just saw someone say ?that?s what a women?s body should look like imo? under a girls picture, like?

first off, no one gives a fuck what you think a woman should look like. and second, it?s so fucked up that you?d even say that because there are a lot of women who don?t have her body shape and are still beautiful.

I really hate men that think they?re opinions are worthy of the world when it does nothing but exclude so many other people.
